Feeding and obesity 喂食和肥胖问题

Go into your local pet shop or supermarket and you’ll be faced with a whole aisle full of cat food! With so many different types and brands out there the choice can be overwhelming. So, how do you know which one to feed to your cat? 

走进附近的宠物商店或者是超市，你就会发现，一整个过道都是猫粮！有着这么多的种类和品牌，选择可以说是相当多。那么，你应该怎样选择来喂养你的猫呢？

A balanced diet 平衡的食谱

Like humans, cats need a balanced diet with the right amount of nutrients, so it’s best to stick to a reputable pet food which includes everything cats need to stay fit and healthy. 

像人类一样，猫咪需要一个营养均衡的均衡食谱。所以最好是坚持喂养一款声誉不错，而且能够涵盖猫咪所需营养，保障其健康苗条的猫粮。

Commercial pet food is classified as either complete or complementary: 

商业猫粮被分为主食粮以及零食粮：

. complete foods provide all the necessary nutrients in the right balance so that no other food needs to be added 

· 主食粮提供比例均衡的猫咪所需营养，不需要再喂食其他食物。

. complementary foods must be combined with other foods to provide a complete balance of nutrients 

· 零食粮则必须和其他主食粮一同喂食，这样才能为猫提供完整均衡的营养。

. whichever food you choose, remember cats always need fresh water, which should be changed daily 

· 无论你选择什么猫粮，记住一定要提供不间断的新鲜饮用水供应，而且需要每天更换。


Cats have a higher protein requirement than many other mammals and so must eat meat to satisfy their needs. However, there is no need to feed your cat an entirely homemade or fresh food diet, unless this is recommended by your vet for medical reasons. 

相比较与其他动物，猫需要更高的蛋白质摄入，因此必须吃肉来满足它们的需要。无论如何，除非是因为医疗原因你的兽医建议，没有必要去为你的猫准备完全自制的食物，或者是生肉食物。

It’s very difficult to provide the right range and balance of proteins, vitamins and minerals that cats need to thrive. An unbalanced diet can cause growth problems and/or medical conditions. 

通常很难为猫的成长发育配比出种类齐全、配比均衡的蛋白质、维他命和矿物质的猫粮。不平衡的猫粮可能引发成长问题或者是健康问题。

If you are feeding your cat a reputable complete cat food, there is no need to give your cat a vitamin supplement unless advised by your vet. It may cause a dietary imbalance which could be harmful. 

如果你现在给猫喂食的是大牌的主食粮，那么除非有兽医的建议，你不需要另外给猫补充维生素。这样可能会造成营养不均衡，有些时候可能是有害的。

If you have adopted a cat it’s wise to keep them on the same food that they have been used to as a sudden change of diet can cause an upset stomach. If you would like to change your cat’s diet you can slowly introduce the new food by mixing it with the old food over a period of a week or more. 

如果你收养一只猫，那么最好是给它们喂食之前的猫粮。突然变换猫粮可能造成肠胃问题。如果你想要更换它的猫粮，那么最好是在一周或者更长时间里，慢慢的把新猫粮掺到旧猫粮里。

Remember, your cat… 记住，你的猫有以下特征

. is an obligate carnivore and must have amino acids such as taurine that can only be found in meat, so they cannot be a vegetarian 

· 是纯肉食动物，其必需的牛磺酸只能从肉类中获取，所以猫是不可能吃素的。

. should not be fed dog food. The balance of ingredients are not suitable for cats’ digestive systems and will not provide your cat with all the nutrients they need 

· 不应该被喂狗粮，狗粮的营养配比与猫的消化系统并不匹配，也不能提供猫所需的所有营养。

. likes to eat, drink and toilet in different places. In an evolutionary sense this allows them to avoid water that may be contaminated with waste from prey, so move the water bowl to a site away from the food bowl and move the litter tray away from both the food and water bowls 

· 倾向于在不同的地方进食、饮水以及排泄。在进化的意义上，这种方式能够避免水被猎物污染。所以尽量把水碗放置的离食碗远一点，并且把猫砂盆放的离这二者都远一点。

. prefers to eat away from other cats. Reduce any potential competition for food between cats by feeding them in different areas of the house 

· 喜欢吃别的猫的食物。通过在不同的区域喂养不同猫，来避免猫之间的食物争夺。

Wet or dry food? 湿粮还是干粮？

You can feed your cat wet or dry food, or a mixture of both.

你可以给你的猫喂湿粮或者是干粮，或者二者混合喂也可以。

Wet foods 湿粮

These are normally available in tins or pouches. Wet food is soft and there are many different flavours to choose from. You may find it more appealing to a fussy eater. 

湿粮通常是罐头或者袋装的。湿粮很软并且有很多口味可供选择。对于挑嘴的猫，可能湿粮会更适口。

Dry foods 干粮

These can be a practical choice for many owners as they can be left out all day for your cat to nibble on and can be beneficial for the teeth and gums. Using feeding balls to give some, or all, of your cat’s daily dry food ration can help to lessen the unnatural boredom that can result from cats eating food from bowls and provides some exercise. However, if your cat has a medical condition requiring increased water intake, such as urinary problems, your vet may suggest avoiding dry food and feeding only wet food. 

对于很多主人来说，干粮可能是更实际的选择。因为干粮可以被放置一整天，以供猫咪不时食用。并且对猫的牙齿和牙龈还有好处。你可以用喂食球来喂部分或者全部的猫粮，这样可以减轻从食盆进食带来的枯燥感，同时也能让猫有更多的锻炼。无论如何，如果你的猫有健康上的状况（比如尿道问题），需要增加饮水摄入，你的兽医可能会建议避免喂食干粮而只喂食湿粮。


How much? 喂多少？

This depends on the type of food you give your cat, their size, age and their level of activity. Follow the advice given on the food packet for the daily amount and then monitor your cat’s weight periodically. It is very important to avoid overfeeding. 

这个问题取决于你喂给猫的食物种类、猫的大小、年龄以及它们的活动量。遵循猫粮袋子上的每日喂食建议，并且定期监控猫的体重变化。避免过度喂食很重要。

Remember, owners have a legal duty of care to provide for their cat s needs, which includes the need for an appropriate diet including fresh water see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Cats and the law. 

记住，主人为猫提供其所需（包括均衡的饮食以及新鲜的饮用水），是法律的要求。参见猫咪保护基本指导之猫咪和法律篇。


How often? 多久喂一次？

Cats have evolved to eat little and often – in the wild a cat would eat around 10-12 small meals throughout the day. Pet cats will often prefer the same, although their feeding behaviour is influenced by their environment and previous experiences. Fresh wet food should be replaced at least twice daily and dry food at least once daily. Once neutered, cats typically have reduced energy needs, so consider cutting down their daily amount accordingly. 

猫在进化中养成了少吃多吃的习惯，在野生环境中猫可能会在一天里吃十顿到十二顿。宠物猫通常会倾向如此，不过根据实际情况和过往经历也会有所变化。新鲜的湿粮应该每天被替换两次，干粮则每天一次。做过绝育的猫的能量需要会少一些，因此适当考虑削减其猫粮供应。

Hunting 狩猎

Although you provide your cat with food, they will still need to exhibit hunting behaviour. Cats share common ancestry with the African wildcat which spends many hours actively hunting prey, using frequent short bursts of energy followed by periods of rest. The drive to hunt is not triggered by hunger – since not every hunting expedition is successful, it wouldn’t make sense to risk waiting until hunger strikes before seeking prey. 

尽管有你为猫提供食物，但是它们仍然需要宣泄狩猎的冲动。猫的祖先为非洲野猫，这种猫可能在狩猎上花费几个小时。经常有短暂的能量爆发并且伴随着之后的休息。这种狩猎的冲动不是因为饥饿。既然不是每次狩猎都能成功，那么在饿肚子之前多猎食就很有道理。

Each part of the hunting activity – the stalk, pounce, play and kill – releases feel-good hormones called endorphins. It is important that your pet cat is still given frequent opportunities to play and exhibit this hunting behaviour to keep them mentally stimulated. Cats that have free access to the outdoors will still often engage in hunting activity – playing with fallen leaves or grass blowing in the wind if there is no access to prey – even though they also get fed a bowl of food. Encouraging play with fishing rod toys and other toys is a great outlet for this activity and will keep your cat happy and reduce stress. For more information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guides: Understanding your cat’s behaviour and Caring for your cat. 

狩猎过程中的每个步骤（跟踪、跃起、玩弄、杀死）都会释放一种让猫感觉良好的激素叫内啡肽。经常给猫这样的狩猎机会能够让它的精神保持活跃。能够自由出门的猫虽然可能已经有一碗的猫粮，但是一旦没有猎物可以捕获，就会进行类似的活动，玩耍落叶或者是追逐被风吹动的草等。经常用逗猫棒或者其他玩具可以很好的释放这种冲动，并且保持你的猫愉悦，为你的猫减压。需要更多信息请参照猫咪保护基本指导之了解猫的行为篇以及关爱你的猫篇。

Obesity 肥胖

It is important that you manage your cat’s weight by ensuring they are not overfed and have plenty of opportunities to exercise. Prevention is better than cure. A cat that has been overweight before is more prone to weight gain. You should be able to feel your cat’s ribs easily when you stroke their body lightly and you should clearly see a waistline when you look at them from above. 

通过控制喂食以及进行锻炼来控制猫的体重相当重要。预防永远要比后期治疗要好。一个曾经肥胖过的猫更容易增重。当你抚摸猫的身体时，应当能够轻易摸到它们的肋骨。而且从上面看，你应该能够很轻易的看到它们的腰线。

Overweight cats are usually defined as being greater than 15 per cent over their ideal body weight, while the term obese is used for cats that are 30 per cent above their ideal weight. Cats under two years of age are less likely to gain weight. Between two and 10 years, cats use up less energy so are more at risk of becoming overweight. Senior and geriatric cats – aged 12 years and over – have a tendency to be underweight. 

猫的体重比理想体重多15%则定义为超重，多30%则定义为肥胖。小于两岁的猫不太容易增肥。大于两岁且小于十岁这段时间，它们的能量需求减少，因而更容易超重。年长或者是老年猫（指大于十二岁的猫）则通常会体重减少。

It is difficult to feel an obese cat’s ribs because they will be covered by a layer of fat. There is often a drooping ‘skirt’ underneath the cat and when looked at from above, the back will look broad or flat with no obvious waist. Many overweight or obese cats have a poor quality of life. Their weight can restrict their ability to groom properly. They can also suffer with joint problems and have an increased risk of developing weight-related diseases such as diabetes mellitus and urinary infections. In severe cases, owners can actually kill their cat with kindness by overfeeding. 

对于一个肥胖的猫，其肋骨被一层脂肪覆盖，会很难被摸到。肥胖猫通常会有个下垂的肚子，从上面看后背宽广平实，不会有明显的腰。很多超重或者是肥胖的猫生活质量都不高，它们的体重会使得自我清洁变得困难。它们也会遇到关节上的问题，或者是患上超重导致的糖尿病和尿路感染等疾病。严重的情况下，主人的善意造成的过量喂食会实质上杀死猫。

If your cat is overweight, a vet can help you find an appropriate feeding regime which will ensure that they get the right amount of food without being overfed. It is a good idea to weigh food out daily. Many dry foods come with calibrated scoops, but it is easy to overfill these. Remember that any treats will add calories onto the daily ration. If you like to give your cat treats throughout the day, it is much better to put a small amount of the daily portion aside so that you don’t increase the total amount of food eaten throughout the day. 

如果你的猫超重了，兽医可以给你提供一个正确恰当的喂食策略，保证在猫得到足够食物的同时避免被过量喂食。每天称一称猫粮的重量是个不错的主意。很多干粮都会附带称量猫粮的勺子，不过很容易出现过量的现象。记住任何的零食都会在每天的营养平衡上添加多余的卡路里。如果你想给猫喂零食，那么最好把主食减少一部分。这样你就保持了猫全天进食的食物总量。

Overweight cats should never be starved or put on a ‘crash diet’ as any period of no food can very quickly be harmful. A gradual, steady decrease in bodyweight is ideal – it may take up to a year for a severely overweight cat to reach its ideal body condition. 

超重的猫绝不能被饿着或者是喂速成的低卡路里食谱。任何阶段的断粮都会对猫造成伤害。渐进的稳定减重对猫是理想的。对于一个严重超重的猫，可能需要耗时一年才能恢复到理想的体重和身体状态。

It can be difficult to manage a cat’s weight in multi-cat households – any household with more than one cat. Some cats will happily finish anything the others do not appear to want. Feeding the overweight cat in a separate room can give the other cats in the household some time to eat. Any leftover food should be removed before the overweight cat is let out of the room so that it can’t be finished off. 

对于养了多只猫的家庭来说，控制一只猫的体重可能很困难。因为某些猫会很高兴的吃掉其他猫不想吃的猫粮。所以最好在一个单独的房间喂超重猫，而且给其他猫固定的吃饭时间，之后清理掉剩下的猫粮，这样超重猫就不会多吃了。

Providing the overweight cat with a toy that slowly releases food can help to increase the amount of time they spend eating and give them a little exercise. Alternatively, food can be placed inside cardboard boxes with holes cut in the side that are large enough for all cats to fit through except for the overweight cat – this allows the other cats in the house to eat whenever they wish. They will need to be shown the new location of their food. Microchip pet feeders are available that restrict access to food to specific cats – linked to their unique microchips. 

给超重的猫一个喂食的玩具让它能够获得更多的锻炼。或者，你可以把猫粮放在一个纸箱里，这个纸箱上开一个超重猫刚刚好不能探进头去的洞。这样除了超重的猫，其他猫都能自由的吃到猫粮。当然它们需要给告知新猫粮的位置。能够识别芯片的猫粮喂食器能够根据猫的唯一芯片来决定是不是给特定的猫供粮。

Cats living in the wild are generally solitary and aren’t used to living in social groups like dogs, so it can be stressful for cats to live together, even if they are siblings. Long term stress in some cats can lead to them overeating, while others may lose weight. For more information on multi-cat households, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Cats living together. It is hard to notice weight loss or weight gain in a cat that you see every day so it is a good idea to weigh your cat regularly. Most cats will not sit still on a scale, so weigh a carrying box or yourself, then weigh your cat in the box or while you are holding it and subtract the excess weight to get that of the cat. Many vet practices offer weight clinics, where they can regularly weigh your cat using special pet weighing scales. 

在野生环境中猫通常都是自主生活，不像狗一样会群居生活，因此哪怕是和兄弟姐妹们一起生活都会让猫感到有压力。长时间的紧张焦虑可能会使一些猫超量饮食，也可能让一些猫食欲减退。需要更多关于多猫喂养的信心，请参见猫咪保护基本指导之群居篇。对于一个每天都看到猫来说，很难分辨其是变重了还是变轻了，所以最好是定期给猫咪称体重。大部分猫不会安分的坐在称上，所以你可以准备一个笼子（或者是你本人），先称笼子（或者是人）的重量，然后把猫放进笼子（或者人抱起来）再称重。用后一个重量减去前一个重量就是猫的实际体重。很多兽医机构提供专门的体重测量，能够定期用宠物专用称秤量猫的体重。

Because exercise is such an important part of weight control, indoor cats are particularly prone to obesity and it can be a manifestation of stress. It can be useful to look at your obese cat’s lifestyle, its environment and placement of resources, as well as its diet. For more information, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guides: Caring for your cat and Indoor and outdoor cats. 

对于控制体重，运动相当重要。室内猫更容易肥胖并且焦虑。你最好是检查一下肥胖猫的生活方式、环境、猫粮等生活资料的放置以及它的饮食。需要更多信息，请参阅猫咪保护基本指导之关爱你的猫篇以及室内室外猫篇。

And to drink… 至于饮水...

Make sure your cat has fresh water available at all times: 

确保你的猫在任何时候都能喝到新鲜的饮用水：

. cats that are fed an entirely dry diet tend to drink more water 

· 被喂全干粮的猫倾向于喝更多的水

. wet food is 90 per cent water so cats require little in addition to this but always offer plenty 

· 湿粮含有90%的水，所以猫可能不需要额外补充很多。不过还是要提供足量的水供猫饮用。

. some cats prefer to drink from puddles or ponds – this is normal 

· 有些猫喜欢从水坑或者是池塘喝水，这是正常现象。

. if your cat’s drinking habits change and they noticeably drink more or less, this may be an early indication of a medical problem, so contact your vet 

· 如果你猫的喝水习惯发生了改变，突然喝的更多或者更少了，这通常是健康问题的表现，你需要联系兽医。

. avoid giving your cat cow’s milk – around a third of cats can’t tolerate it and it can lead to sickness and diarrhoea 

· 不要给你的猫喂牛奶，因为大约三分之一的猫不能消化牛奶，并且会导致腹泻等疾病。

. specially formulated milk for cats is available but this should only be given as an occasional treat as it very high in calories – it should never be given instead of water 

· 猫咪专用奶可以喂不过只能是临时的奖励，因为其中含有大量卡路里，绝不可以被当成水的替代品。

Some cats benefit from being encouraged to drink more, particularly those suffering from conditions of the urinary tract, such as cystitis or kidney disease. This should be discussed with your vet. 

对于有的猫，多饮水很有好处，尤其是那些有泌尿系统疾病（包括膀胱炎、肾脏疾病）的猫。这种情况你可以咨询你的兽医。

To encourage cats to drink more: 

通过以下方式可以让你猫更多喝水：

. avoid plastic containers – use glass, ceramic or metal instead. Cats are very sensitive to taste and plastic can taint the water 

· 不要使用塑料水盆。而用玻璃、陶瓷或者是金属的替代。猫对味道很敏感，而塑料让水闻起来变质。

. offer a large, shallow water bowl with a large surface area. Cats do not like their shadow blocking the view of the surface of the water when they go to drink and some don’t like their whiskers touching the sides of the bowl 

· 提供一个大而浅的水盆。喝水的时候，猫不喜欢水面全都是自己的倒影。有些猫也不喜欢喝水时候胡子碰到碗边。

. place some extra ‘cat use only’ glasses on high up surfaces if you find your cat likes helping themselves to your glass of water. Ensure these are sturdy so the cat cannot knock them over 

· 如果你发现猫喜欢喝你杯子里的水，那么在更高位置上放置仅供猫饮用的水杯。想办法固定好，以免被猫撞倒。

. try offering a water fountain – cats often prefer moving water 

· 试着提供喷泉供猫饮用，猫喜欢流动的水

. offer filtered water – some cats are sensitive to the chlorine in the water 

· 提供过滤水，有些猫对水中的氯很敏感

. ensure the water bowl is sited in a location acceptable to the cat. Cats need to be able to access their water without having to pass objects that they perceive to be threatening, such as other cats or dogs. Provide more than one bowl in different locations throughout the house and avoid placing the water right next to their food 

· 确保水碗的位置对猫合适。猫需要能自由达到水碗而无须经过那些让它感到受威胁的事物，比如其他猫或者是狗。在家里不同位置放置几个水碗，并且不要放在它们食物附近。


Cats that usually drink from a water source outside may find that this source is inaccessible one day, so although some cats seem not to drink the water that is provided, it is important that fresh water is always available. 

在外饮水的猫有可能会发现水源突然不能喝了，鉴于此，尽管很多猫不会喝家里的水，但总是提供备用的新鲜水是必要的。

Why isn’t my cat eating? 为什么我的猫不吃东西了？

Many owners report that their cat is fussy. However, sometimes we are too quick to offer the cat something else, often more palatable, if they appear disinterested in the food presented. The cat then learns over time that if they hold off, they may be offered something more tempting. 

很多主人都抱怨自己的猫挑嘴。然而，当猫对食物表现出不屑时，我们往往太快作出反应，替换成了更好吃的食物。这样时间久了猫就会记住，只要它们憋住不吃，就可能获得更好吃的。

While some cats are fussier than others, cats may stop eating because of stress or illness and should be checked by a vet. Odour, texture and temperature of food are important factors for cats and can be manipulated to tempt the problem feeder or sick cat. To encourage a cat to eat, try: 

尽管有的猫就是别其他的挑嘴，不过有的时候猫停止进食是因为焦虑或者是疾病，应该由兽医进行相关检查。食物的气味、质地、温度都是影响猫食欲的重要原因。在这些方面下手可以尽量诱使其进食。为了让猫进食，你可以尝试：

. offering a range of different wet and dry foods at different times – making sure you introduce new foods slowly 

· 在不同的时间提供不同种类的干粮和湿粮，确保你是在缓慢的改喂新的猫粮。

. giving wet food at room temperature rather than straight from the fridge – in general, cats prefer this 

· 给予常温的湿粮，而不是刚从冰箱里拿出来的那种。猫往往喜欢常温的。

. offering regular small amounts of food rather than a large bowl. This can be less overwhelming and means that the food is always fresh

· 尽量提供小份猫粮，而不是直接给一大碗。这样对猫的消化压力小一点，而且意味着食物更加新鲜。

. offering food with a strong odour. Warming food up a little will increase the aroma. Make sure it’s not too hot, body temperature is ideal 

· 提供气味更浓的猫粮。微微加热之后，猫粮的气味就会更加浓郁。不过要确保猫粮不要过热，加热到体温就刚好。

. adding a drop of a yeast extract spread or fish oil or a small amount of kitten food to the meal. This can make it more appetising but should be regulated and not performed on a long term basis. Ask your vet if this is suitable for your cat 

· 加入一滴鱼油的酵母提取物，或者是少量的幼猫猫粮。这样可能会让猫粮更加可口，不过不应该长期使用这种方式。具体可以咨询兽医这样是否合适。

. sitting down with your cat or hand feeding can encourage eating to start. Once a cat starts to eat it can induce an appetite 

· 和你的猫坐在一起，或者是用手喂可以鼓励它们开始进食。一旦它开吃了就会有胃口了。

. a sick cat may need to be given a special diet by the vet who can advise on how best to tempt the cat 

· 病猫可能需要兽医提供特殊的食谱，因为兽医知道怎么最好的让猫吃食。

While cooked fish or chicken is sometimes used to stimulate a cat’s appetite, other human foods should be avoided. Food containing onions, or onion powder, can be potentially toxic and life threatening if ingested by a cat. 

尽管炖鱼和炖鸡有时候可以被用来给猫咪开胃，其他的人类食物不应该改被喂给猫。包含洋葱或者是洋葱粉的食物，一旦被猫食用，可能是有毒的，而且可能会对猫有生命威胁。

A familiar diet is preferred at times of stress, so ensure that an acceptable diet is available if your cat is placed in a different environment, such as in a cattery, to help avoid any refusal to eat or stomach upsets from a change of diet. 

对于紧张的猫咪来说，熟悉的食谱更好。所以如果你的猫要被放到另一个环境中（比如猫舍），那么最好给它提供之前的猫粮。这样能够避免任何因为换粮造成的拒食或者是肠胃不适。

Special diets and life-stage feeding 特殊饮食以及生命各个阶段的喂养

Cats’ dietary needs change according to their age and health and there are a range of specific foods available eg kitten, senior, indoor, sensitive or low calorie. A special diet may be prescribed by your vet if your cat has a health problem such as kidney disease or joint problems. This should be given as instructed, only to the cat it is prescribed to. If possible, it is preferable to introduce the new diet gradually while the cat still has access to its original diet. 

猫的营养需求会依据年龄、健康状况发生变化。市面上对于不同类别的猫（幼猫、老年猫、室内猫、肠胃敏感猫、需要低蛋白的猫）也有很多种猫粮可供选择。如果你的猫有肾脏疾病或者是关节疾病，那你的兽医会开具处方性质的猫粮。这种猫粮应该按处方给予特定的猫。如果可能，最好是逐渐替换之前的猫粮。

It can be difficult to feed a prescription diet to a cat if you have other cats in the household. See the information on obesity above for some tips on how to feed cats different diets. 

如果你屋子里还有其他的猫，给某个猫喂处方粮就可能相当困难。可以参加以上关于肥胖的部分关于如何给不同猫喂不同食谱的建议。

Pregnant cats and mums feeding kittens 怀孕猫以及哺育期的猫

Pregnant cats and those feeding kittens have increased nutritional requirements and need the same high-protein kitten food as weaned kittens. Give the pregnant cat unlimited access to kitten food and fresh drinking water. During pregnancy she is likely to eat only a little more than normal but when she is suckling kittens, she has to produce so much milk that she may eat double or triple her normal amount. For more advice, speak to your vet or contact Cats Protection’s Helpline on 03000 12 12 12. For general information, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Pregnant cats, birth and care of young kittens. 

孕猫以及正在哺乳期的猫有更大的营养需求，和断奶后的幼猫一样，需要更高蛋白质的幼猫食物。给孕猫提供不限量的幼猫食物以及新鲜的饮用水。怀孕期间，她可能比平时吃的少。但是当她开始喂小猫的时候，为了产奶她可能需要吃两倍或者是三倍食量的猫粮。需要更多建议，咨询你的兽医或者是联系Cats Protection帮助热线（ 03000 12 12 12）。需要大致的信息，可以参阅猫咪保护基本指导之孕猫、生产以及幼猫护理篇。

Kittens 幼猫

Providing your cat with a balanced diet throughout her pregnancy and while she is suckling means she should be able to feed her kittens until they are weaned at six to eight weeks old. You can begin the weaning process by providing well-mashed kitten food from three to four weeks of age. If the litter is very large you may have to supplement their diet with specialised kitten milk at an earlier age. If the mum cannot feed her young or the kittens are orphaned, you will need to take over the feeding completely. If this is the case, contact your vet for advice or call the Cats Protection Helpline 03000 12 12 12. Kittens have small stomachs and high energy requirements, so need to be fed little and often. Their food should generally be checked and replaced four times daily. 

给孕猫提供平衡的营养膳食，当它能够分泌乳汁的时候，就可以说它能够喂养这些小猫了。小猫长到六到八周大的时候就会断奶。你可以在断奶初期给小猫喂食碾碎的幼猫猫粮。如果排泄物很多，你可能需要提早喂食幼猫专用的牛奶。如果猫妈妈不能喂养小猫或者是没有猫妈妈，那么你需要自己完成喂养。如果是这种情况，联系兽医获取建议或者是给Cats Protection（03000 12 12 12）打电话咨询。幼猫胃口很小但是需要很多营养，需要经常的、少量的喂。幼猫的食物应当每天被检查、替换四次。

Adults 成年猫

A cat food classed as ‘adult’ is for cats from one to eight years of age. Cats tend to be fed once or twice a day but some will regulate their food intake throughout the day, so the daily ration can be left out for them, particularly if they are fed on dried food. 

大于一岁小于八岁的猫称为成年猫，猫倾向每天被喂食一到两次。不过有些猫可能会把每天的猫粮分几次吃完。所以你可以把每天的猫粮（尤其是干粮的话）留在那里，让它自己随时吃。

Senior cats 老年猫
A cat food classed as ‘senior’ is for cats over eight years old. Cats experience changes as they get older and their nutritional requirements change with age. There are many foods aimed at senior cats which provide the different dietary requirements needed for their age, such as lower protein content and nutrients to promote optimum health. 

超过八岁的猫被称为老年猫。随着变老，猫会逐渐发生变化，它们的营养需求会改变。市面上有很多面向老年猫的猫粮，可以满足各年龄段的营养需求，比如低蛋白质猫粮等。
