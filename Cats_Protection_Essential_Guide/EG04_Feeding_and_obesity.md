Feeding and obesity 喂食和肥胖问题


Go into your local pet shop or supermarket and you’ll be faced with a whole aisle full of cat food! With so many different types and brands out there the choice can be overwhelming. So, how do you know which one to feed to your cat? 

走进附近的宠物商店或者是超市，你就会发现，一整个过道都是猫粮！有着这么多的种类和品牌，选择可以说是相当多。那么，你应该怎样选择来喂养你的猫呢？

A balanced diet 平衡的食谱

Like humans, cats need a balanced diet with the right amount of nutrients, so it’s best to stick to a reputable pet food which includes everything cats need to stay fit and healthy. 

像人类一样，猫咪需要一个营养均衡的均衡食谱。所以最好是坚持喂养一款声誉不错，而且能够涵盖猫咪所需营养，保障其健康苗条的猫粮。

Commercial pet food is classified as either complete or complementary: 

商业猫粮被分为主食粮以及零食粮：

. complete foods provide all the necessary nutrients in the right balance so that no other food needs to be added 

· 主食粮提供比例均衡的猫咪所需营养，不需要再喂食其他食物。

. complementary foods must be combined with other foods to provide a complete balance of nutrients 

· 零食粮则必须和其他主食粮一同喂食，这样才能为猫提供完整均衡的营养。

. whichever food you choose, remember cats always need fresh water, which should be changed daily 

· 无论你选择什么猫粮，记住一定要提供不间断的新鲜饮用水供应，而且需要每天更换。


Cats have a higher protein requirement than many other mammals and so must eat meat to satisfy their needs. However, there is no need to feed your cat an entirely homemade or fresh food diet, unless this is recommended by your vet for medical reasons. 

相比较与其他动物，猫需要更高的蛋白质摄入，因此必须吃肉来满足它们的需要。无论如何，除非是因为医疗原因你的兽医建议，没有必要去为你的猫准备完全自制的食物，或者是生肉食物。

It’s very difficult to provide the right range and balance of proteins, vitamins and minerals that cats need to thrive. An unbalanced diet can cause growth problems and/or medical conditions. 

通常很难为猫的成长发育配比出种类齐全、配比均衡的蛋白质、维他命和矿物质的猫粮。不平衡的猫粮可能引发成长问题或者是健康问题。

If you are feeding your cat a reputable complete cat food, there is no need to give your cat a vitamin supplement unless advised by your vet. It may cause a dietary imbalance which could be harmful. 

如果你现在给猫喂食的是大牌的主食粮，那么除非有兽医的建议，你不需要另外给猫补充维生素。这样可能会造成营养不均衡，有些时候可能是有害的。

If you have adopted a cat it’s wise to keep them on the same food that they have been used to as a sudden change of diet can cause an upset stomach. If you would like to change your cat’s diet you can slowly introduce the new food by mixing it with the old food over a period of a week or more. 

如果你收养一只猫，那么最好是给它们喂食之前的猫粮。突然变换猫粮可能造成肠胃问题。如果你想要更换它的猫粮，那么最好是在一周或者更长时间里，慢慢的把新猫粮掺到旧猫粮里。

Remember, your cat… 记住，你的猫有以下特征

. is an obligate carnivore and must have amino acids such as taurine that can only be found in meat, so they cannot be a vegetarian 

· 是纯肉食动物，其必需的牛磺酸只能从肉类中获取，所以猫是不可能吃素的。

. should not be fed dog food. The balance of ingredients are not suitable for cats’ digestive systems and will not provide your cat with all the nutrients they need 

· 不应该被喂狗粮，狗粮的营养配比与猫的消化系统并不匹配，也不能提供猫所需的所有营养。

. likes to eat, drink and toilet in different places. In an evolutionary sense this allows them to avoid water that may be contaminated with waste from prey, so move the water bowl to a site away from the food bowl and move the litter tray away from both the food and water bowls 

· 倾向于在不同的地方进食、饮水以及排泄。在进化的意义上，这种方式能够避免水被猎物污染。所以尽量把水碗放置的离食碗远一点，并且把猫砂盆放的离这二者都远一点。

. prefers to eat away from other cats. Reduce any potential competition for food between cats by feeding them in different areas of the house 

· 喜欢吃别的猫的食物。通过在不同的区域喂养不同猫，来避免猫之间的食物争夺。

Wet or dry food? 湿粮还是干粮？

You can feed your cat wet or dry food, or a mixture of both.

你可以给你的猫喂湿粮或者是干粮，或者二者混合喂也可以。

Wet foods 湿粮

These are normally available in tins or pouches. Wet food is soft and there are many different flavours to choose from. You may find it more appealing to a fussy eater. 

湿粮通常是罐头或者袋装的。湿粮很软并且有很多口味可供选择。对于挑嘴的猫，可能湿粮会更适口。

Dry foods 干粮

These can be a practical choice for many owners as they can be left out all day for your cat to nibble on and can be beneficial for the teeth and gums. Using feeding balls to give some, or all, of your cat’s daily dry food ration can help to lessen the unnatural boredom that can result from cats eating food from bowls and provides some exercise. However, if your cat has a medical condition requiring increased water intake, such as urinary problems, your vet may suggest avoiding dry food and feeding only wet food. 

对于很多主人来说，干粮可能是更实际的选择。因为干粮可以被放置一整天，以供猫咪不时食用。并且对猫的牙齿和牙龈还有好处。你可以用喂食球来喂部分或者全部的猫粮，这样可以减轻从食盆进食带来的枯燥感，同时也能让猫有更多的锻炼。无论如何，如果你的猫有健康上的状况（比如尿道问题），需要增加饮水摄入，你的兽医可能会建议避免喂食干粮而只喂食湿粮。


How much? 喂多少？

This depends on the type of food you give your cat, their size, age and their level of activity. Follow the advice given on the food packet for the daily amount and then monitor your cat’s weight periodically. It is very important to avoid overfeeding. 

这个问题取决于你喂给猫的食物种类、猫的大小、年龄以及它们的活动量。遵循猫粮袋子上的每日喂食建议，并且定期监控猫的体重变化。避免过度喂食很重要。

Remember, owners have a legal duty of care to provide for their cat s needs, which includes the need for an appropriate diet including fresh water see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Cats and the law. 

记住，主人为猫提供其所需（包括均衡的饮食以及新鲜的饮用水），是法律的要求。参见猫咪保护基本指导之猫咪和法律篇。


How often? 多久喂一次？

Cats have evolved to eat little and often – in the wild a cat would eat around 10-12 small meals throughout the day. Pet cats will often prefer the same, although their feeding behaviour is influenced by their environment and previous experiences. Fresh wet food should be replaced at least twice daily and dry food at least once daily. Once neutered, cats typically have reduced energy needs, so consider cutting down their daily amount accordingly. 

猫在进化中养成了少吃多吃的习惯，在野生环境中猫可能会在一天里吃十顿到十二顿。宠物猫通常会倾向如此，不过根据实际情况和过往经历也会有所变化。新鲜的湿粮应该每天被替换两次，干粮则每天一次。做过绝育的猫的能量需要会少一些，因此适当考虑削减其猫粮供应。

Hunting 狩猎

Although you provide your cat with food, they will still need to exhibit hunting behaviour. Cats share common ancestry with the African wildcat which spends many hours actively hunting prey, using frequent short bursts of energy followed by periods of rest. The drive to hunt is not triggered by hunger – since not every hunting expedition is successful, it wouldn’t make sense to risk waiting until hunger strikes before seeking prey. 

尽管有你为猫提供食物，但是它们仍然需要宣泄狩猎的冲动。猫的祖先为非洲野猫，这种猫可能在狩猎上花费几个小时。经常有短暂的能量爆发并且伴随着之后的休息。这种狩猎的冲动不是因为饥饿。既然不是每次狩猎都能成功，那么在饿肚子之前多猎食就很有道理。

Each part of the hunting activity – the stalk, pounce, play and kill – releases feel-good hormones called endorphins. It is important that your pet cat is still given frequent opportunities to play and exhibit this hunting behaviour to keep them mentally stimulated. Cats that have free access to the outdoors will still often engage in hunting activity – playing with fallen leaves or grass blowing in the wind if there is no access to prey – even though they also get fed a bowl of food. Encouraging play with fishing rod toys and other toys is a great outlet for this activity and will keep your cat happy and reduce stress. For more information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guides: Understanding your cat’s behaviour and Caring for your cat. 

狩猎过程中的每个步骤（跟踪、跃起、玩弄、杀死）都会释放一种让猫感觉良好的激素叫内啡肽。经常给猫这样的狩猎机会能够让它的精神保持活跃。能够自由出门的猫虽然可能已经有一碗的猫粮，但是一旦没有猎物可以捕获，就会进行类似的活动，玩耍落叶或者是追逐被风吹动的草等。经常用逗猫棒或者其他玩具可以很好的释放这种冲动，并且保持你的猫愉悦，为你的猫减压。需要更多信息请参照猫咪保护基本指导之了解猫的行为篇以及关爱你的猫篇。

Obesity 

It is important that you manage your cat’s weight by ensuring they are not overfed and have plenty of opportunities to exercise. Prevention is better than cure. A cat that has been overweight before is more prone to weight gain. You should be able to feel your cat’s ribs easily when you stroke their body lightly and you should clearly see a waistline when you look at them from above. 

Overweight cats are usually defined as being greater than 15 per cent over their ideal body weight, while the term obese is used for cats that are 30 per cent above their ideal weight. Cats under two years of age are less likely to gain weight. Between two and 10 years, cats use up less energy so are more at risk of becoming overweight. Senior and geriatric cats – aged 12 years and over – have a tendency to be underweight. 

It is difficult to feel an obese cat’s ribs because they will be covered by a layer of fat. There is often a drooping ‘skirt’ underneath the cat and when looked at from above, the back will look broad or flat with no obvious waist. Many overweight or obese cats have a poor quality of life. Their weight can restrict their ability to groom properly. They can also suffer with joint problems and have an increased risk of developing weight-related diseases such as diabetes mellitus and urinary infections. In severe cases, owners can actually kill their cat with kindness by overfeeding. 

If your cat is overweight, a vet can help you find an appropriate feeding regime which will ensure that they get the right amount of food without being overfed. It is a good idea to weigh food out daily. Many dry foods come with calibrated scoops, but it is easy to overfill these. Remember that any treats will add calories onto the daily ration. If you like to give your cat treats throughout the day, it is much better to put a small amount of the daily portion aside so that you don’t increase the total amount of food eaten throughout the day. 

Overweight cats should never be starved or put on a ‘crash diet’ as any period of no food can very quickly be harmful. A gradual, steady decrease in bodyweight is ideal – it may take up to a year for a severely overweight cat to reach its ideal body condition. 

It can be difficult to manage a cat’s weight in multi-cat households – any household with more than one cat. Some cats will happily finish anything the others do not appear to want. Feeding the overweight cat in a separate room can give the other cats in the household some time to eat. Any leftover food should be removed before the overweight cat is let out of the room so that it can’t be finished off. 

Providing the overweight cat with a toy that slowly releases food can help to increase the amount of time they spend eating and give them a little exercise. Alternatively, food can be placed inside cardboard boxes with holes cut in the side that are large enough for all cats to fit through except for the overweight cat – this allows the other cats in the house to eat whenever they wish. They will need to be shown the new location of their food. Microchip pet feeders are available that restrict access to food to specific cats – linked to their unique microchips. 

Cats living in the wild are generally solitary and aren’t used to living in social groups like dogs, so it can be stressful for cats to live together, even if they are siblings. Long term stress in some cats can lead to them overeating, while others may lose weight. For more information on multi-cat households, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Cats living together. It is hard to notice weight loss or weight gain in a cat that you see every day so it is a good idea to weigh your cat regularly. Most cats will not sit still on a scale, so weigh a carrying box or yourself, then weigh your cat in the box or while you are holding it and subtract the excess weight to get that of the cat. Many vet practices offer weight clinics, where they can regularly weigh your cat using special pet weighing scales. 

Because exercise is such an important part of weight control, indoor cats are particularly prone to obesity and it can be a manifestation of stress. It can be useful to look at your obese cat’s lifestyle, its environment and placement of resources, as well as its diet. For more information, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guides: Caring for your cat and Indoor and outdoor cats. 

And to drink… 

Make sure your cat has fresh water available at all times: 

. cats that are fed an entirely dry diet tend to drink more water 

. wet food is 90 per cent water so cats require little in addition to this but always offer plenty 

. some cats prefer to drink from puddles or ponds – this is normal 

. if your cat’s drinking habits change and they noticeably drink more or less, this may be an early indication of a medical problem, so contact your vet 

. avoid giving your cat cow’s milk – around a third of cats can’t tolerate it and it can lead to sickness and diarrhoea 

. specially formulated milk for cats is available but this should only be given as an occasional treat as it very high in calories – it should never be given instead of water 
Some cats benefit from being encouraged to drink more, particularly those suffering from conditions of the urinary tract, such as cystitis or kidney disease. This should be discussed with your vet. 
To encourage cats to drink more: 
. avoid plastic containers – use glass, ceramic or metal instead. Cats are very sensitive to taste and plastic can taint the water 

. offer a large, shallow water bowl with a large surface area. Cats do not like their shadow blocking the view of the surface of the water when they go to drink and some don’t like their whiskers touching the sides of the bowl 

. place some extra ‘cat use only’ glasses on high up surfaces if you find your cat likes helping themselves to your glass of water. Ensure these are sturdy so the cat cannot knock them over 

. try offering a water fountain – cats often prefer moving water 

. offer filtered water – some cats are sensitive to the chlorine in the water 

. ensure the water bowl is sited in a location acceptable to the cat. Cats need to be able to access their water without having to pass objects that they perceive to be threatening, such as other cats or dogs. Provide more than one bowl in different locations throughout the house and avoid placing the water right next to their food 


Cats that usually drink from a water source outside may find that this source is inaccessible one day, so although some cats seem not to drink the water that is provided, it is important that fresh water is always available. 


Why isn’t my cat eating? 

Many owners report that their cat is fussy. However, sometimes we are too quick to offer the cat something else, often more palatable, if they appear disinterested in the food presented. The cat then learns over time that if they hold off, they may be offered something more tempting. 

While some cats are fussier than others, cats may stop eating because of stress or illness and should be checked by a vet. Odour, texture and temperature of food are important factors for cats and can be manipulated to tempt the problem feeder or sick cat. To encourage a cat to eat, try: 

. offering a range of different wet and dry foods at different times – making sure you introduce new foods slowly 
. giving wet food at room temperature rather than straight from the fridge – in general, cats prefer this 
. offering regular small amounts of food rather than a large 
bowl. This can be less overwhelming and means that the 
food is always fresh 
. offering food with a strong odour. Warming food up a little will increase the aroma. Make sure it’s not too hot, body temperature is ideal 
. adding a drop of a yeast extract spread or fish oil or a small amount of kitten food to the meal. This can make it more appetising but should be regulated and not performed on a long term basis. Ask your vet if this is suitable for your cat 

. sitting down with your cat or hand feeding can encourage eating to start. Once a cat starts to eat it can induce an appetite 

. a sick cat may need to be given a special diet by the vet who can advise on how best to tempt the cat 

While cooked fish or chicken is sometimes used to stimulate a cat’s appetite, other human foods should be avoided. Food containing onions, or onion powder, can be potentially toxic and life threatening if ingested by a cat. 
A familiar diet is preferred at times of stress, so ensure that an acceptable diet is available if your cat is placed in a different environment, such as in a cattery, to help avoid any refusal to eat or stomach upsets from a change of diet. 

Special diets and life-stage feeding 
Cats’ dietary needs change according to their age and health and there are a range of specific foods available eg kitten, senior, indoor, sensitive or low calorie. A special diet may be prescribed by your vet if your cat has a health problem such as kidney disease or joint problems. This should be given as instructed, only to the cat it is prescribed to. If possible, it is preferable to introduce the new diet gradually while the cat still has access to its original diet. 
It can be difficult to feed a prescription diet to a cat if you have other cats in the household. See the information on obesity above for some tips on how to feed cats different diets. 
Pregnant cats and mums feeding kittens 
Pregnant cats and those feeding kittens have increased nutritional requirements and need the same high-protein kitten food as weaned kittens. Give the pregnant cat unlimited access to kitten food and fresh drinking water. During pregnancy she is likely to eat only a little more than normal but when she is suckling kittens, she has to produce so much milk that she may eat double or triple her normal amount. For more advice, speak to your vet or contact Cats Protection’s Helpline on 03000 12 12 12. For general information, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Pregnant cats, birth and care of young kittens. 

Kittens 
Providing your cat with a balanced diet throughout her pregnancy and while she is suckling means she should be able to feed her kittens until they are weaned at six to eight weeks old. You can begin the weaning process by providing well-mashed kitten food from three to four weeks of age. If the litter is very large you may have to supplement their diet with specialised kitten milk at an earlier age. If the mum cannot feed her young or the kittens are orphaned, you will need to take over the feeding completely. If this is the case, contact your vet for advice or call the Cats Protection Helpline 03000 12 12 12. Kittens have small stomachs and high energy requirements, so need to be fed little and often. Their food should generally be checked and replaced four times daily. 

Adults 
A cat food classed as ‘adult’ is for cats from one to eight years of age. Cats tend to be fed once or twice a day but some will regulate their food intake throughout the day, so the daily ration can be left out for them, particularly if they are fed on dried food. 

Senior cats 
A cat food classed as ‘senior’ is for cats over eight years old. Cats experience changes as they get older and their nutritional requirements change with age. There are many foods aimed at senior cats which provide the different dietary requirements needed for their age, such as lower protein content and nutrients to promote optimum health.
