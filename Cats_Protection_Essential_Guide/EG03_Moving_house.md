Moving house 搬家


On the move 转移中

Moving house can be a big deal for cats – much of their feeling of security and ability to relax comes from being surrounded by the familiar sights, sounds and scents of their own territory. It is also very stressful for humans too, so some thought and careful planning will ensure it’s a smooth move for everyone.

搬家对于猫咪来说可能是个大事情，它们大部分的安全感都来自被领地熟悉的标记、声音和气味环绕。即便对人类来说，搬家也是让人头大的事情。所以提前考虑一些事情病情精细筹划来确保搬迁的顺利。 

Planning ahead 提前筹划

There are two options for moving day: booking your cat into a cattery or taking them with you as you move. Which one you choose depends on your own personal preference and your cat’s character, as every cat is different. 

搬迁那天，对于猫咪有两种选择：把猫寄养到猫舍或者是带着猫和你一同搬家。这个选择取决于你的个人倾向以及你猫咪的性格，每只猫的性格都不一样。

Booking your cat into a boarding cattery 把猫寄养到猫舍

If you book your cat into a boarding cattery for a few days, you won’t have to worry about them while you move. This may be the easiest solution for both of you, but you will need to organise it well in advance and make sure your cat’s vaccinations are up to date prior to moving. 

如果要把你的猫寄养到猫舍几天时间，你就可以不用担心在搬家的时候担心它们。这可能对你和猫都是最简单的解决方案了，不过尽量提前安排好，确保你的猫的疫苗接种不被搬家延误。


Keeping your cat with you 带猫咪一同搬家

This option requires a bit more planning. What follows is just a guide and, as everyone’s circumstances are different, you may need to alter parts of it to fit your own situation and your cat’s character. 

这个选项需要更多的筹划。以下仅仅是个指导，鉴于每个人的情况不同，你可能需要根据你自己的情况和猫的性格适当更改部分计划。

First, allocate a room in your home that can be cleared of furniture a week or two before the move. At the same time, decide on a room in the new home where you can put your cat when you get there. Ideally, both rooms should be out of the way so your cat can be left undisturbed for as much of the move as possible. 

首先，准备一个能在搬家前一两周将家具清空的房间。同时计划好新家里准备留给猫咪的某个房间。理想状态下，这两个房间都应该远离过道，这样你的猫就能在搬家过程中不被打搅。

About a week before the big day, start getting your cat used to ‘their’ room. Pop an additional sleeping place, litter tray, cat carrier and blanket in there. You could begin feeding them here too so they become really familiar with their ‘safe place’. On the evening before the move, move their scratching post, toys and water bowl into the room and shut them in to make sure they don’t go missing. If you have more than one cat, make sure they have separate resources if possible, to help prevent further stress or any toileting accidents. If you know your cats don’t enjoy each other’s company, it may be better to give them separate ‘safe rooms’. You could also use a synthetic form of facial pheromones, which are available from your vet. Feliway is available as a plug in diffuser or a spray. The scent helps to create a reassuring environment and may help to reduce stress. 

搬家前一周，开始让你的猫习惯上述房间。在这个房间内放置额外的猫窝、猫砂盆、猫笼以及毯子。你可以开始在这个房间喂它们，这样它们就会对这个间安全屋更加熟悉。在搬家的前夜，把它的猫抓板、玩具和水碗都移放到这个房间，关上门以防它们走失。如果你有不止一只猫咪，确保它们有足够的生活补给，这样能避免它们对未来的恐惧以及上厕所的问题。如果你确信你的猫咪们不喜欢彼此的陪伴，那最好是提供两个“安全屋”。你可以同样使用从兽医那里买到的面部荷尔蒙合成剂。费洛蒙喷剂可以是喷剂或者是喷雾，这种味道能够形成让猫放松的环境，帮助猫咪减轻压力。

Moving day 搬家当天

If you are taking your cat to a cattery, do this the day before if possible, so they are away from all the commotion. 
If they are staying at home, keep them in their room, feed them a small meal, make sure they have fresh water, clean the litter tray and shut the door. Once you are ready to leave, you can put them into their carrier and load them into the car along with all of their belongings. Your cat may be less anxious if the carrier is sprayed with the synthetic facial pheromones a few minutes before placing your cat in the carrier. If they are prone to travel sickness it is worth withholding food for three to four hours before the journey. 

如果你想把猫寄存在猫舍，那么尽早在搬家之前。这样可以避免猫咪受到搬家动乱的影响。如果它们需要在家里呆着，那么把它们关在房间，喂适当的食物，确保饮用水充足、清理猫砂盆然后关紧房门。一旦你收拾好其他，准备好离开了，你可以把它们放到猫箱中并且连同箱子和它的物件们一起放进汽车。如果猫笼几分钟前被喷过合成面部荷尔蒙，那你的猫咪会感到更加放松。如果你的猫容易在出行中得病，那么最好在箱子里提前放上三四个小时的猫粮。

Once you have arrived at your new home, take them to their secure room with all their familiar bits and pieces. You might also like to give them something that smells of you, like an unwashed item of clothing, to help them settle. Provide them with something to eat, a box or something to hide in and make sure they have a litter tray. Then close the door and leave your cat alone for a while – tell the removal staff and the rest of the family which room your cat is in so they don’t disturb them or accidently let them out. You may also want to tack a sign on the door. 

一旦你到达了你的新家，把它们以及它们的物件们全部拿到安全屋。你也可以给它们一些有你味道的东西，比如没洗的衣物，这样能够帮助它们安定下来。给它们一些吃的，一个能隐藏自己的箱子，并且确保它们有猫砂盆可以用。然后关上门让它们独处一会儿。知会搬家公司的员工以及你家里的其他人猫咪房间的位置，这样他们就不会偶然打扰到猫咪或者是把猫放跑。你同样可以在门上钉一个告示。

Settling in 适应新家

It is a good idea to keep your cat in their new room for a few days; it can be overwhelming to have access to the whole of the house straight away. Most cats will let you know when they are ready to venture further and it very much depends on your cat’s individual character. However, when you let them see the rest of the house, make sure that all doors, windows and cat flaps are closed – they’re not ready for the outside world yet! Make sure they always have access to their ‘safe room’ in case they feel the need to retreat. 

最好让你的猫在新的房间内呆几天。探索整个屋子对猫咪来说可能过于压力山大。当时机合适的时候，大多数的猫都会告诉你它能够探索更多的房间。这取决你的猫的性格特质。无论如何，当你放他们出来探索整个房子，确保所有的门窗、猫门是关闭的。他们还没有做好准备面对外面的世界。确保它们在需要休息的时候，能够回到自己的安全屋。

Going outside 到外面去

It’s important that your cat feels relaxed and secure in their new house before exploring the great outdoors. Some cats go missing shortly after moving house because owners have let their cats go outside too soon. These cats sometimes find their way back to their old houses. Cats should be kept indoors for at least three weeks to allow them time to regard the new house as a secure place and to build up a scent profile to help them find their way back. 

在放猫咪探索大自然之前，很重要的就是让它感到放松和有安全感。一些猫之所以会在搬家后很快走失，就是因为主人让它们过早的离开了房子。这些猫有时候能够找到路回到自己之前住的房子。猫至少应该在室内关三周，这样会让它认定新家是个安全的区域并且建立能够帮它们自主返回的气味特征。

When you do let them out: 

当你确实要放它们出门时：

. do it just before a mealtime when they are hungry so you can call them back with their favourite food 

· 在用餐时间之前放它们出门，这样你可以用它们最喜欢的食物召唤它们回来。

. open the door and step outside encouraging your cat to go with you 

· 开门，走到屋外，鼓励猫和你一起走出来。

. don’t pick them up – let them make the decision to go outside themselves 

· 不要抱起它们，让它们自主决定是否出门。

. leave the door open so they can run back into the house if they feel insecure 

· 把家门敞开，这样它们感到不安的时候可以立刻折返回家里。

. only let them out for short periods at first – you can gradually build up the time they are out until you are confident they can come and go as they please 

· 在一开始只让它们短暂出门，你可以逐渐延长外出时间，直到你确信它们能够来去自如。

Before letting your cat out, make sure they are microchipped so if they wander off they can be traced easily. If they are already microchipped, don’t forget to change your address details on the central database when you move. 

在让你猫能够外出之前，确保它们已经被植入芯片。这样万一猫咪走失的时候，能够很容易被寻回。如果它们已经被植入芯片，别忘了在搬家后更新你的地址资料。

Also, don’t forget to register with a new vet, who is likely to request your cat’s veterinary history from your previous practice. If your cat has existing health issues, you may wish to organise this before you move. For further details, see our Veterinary Guide: You and your vet. 

同样的，不要忘记联系一个新的兽医。新的兽医往往会需要之前兽医提供你猫咪的医疗历史。如果你的猫有健康问题。你可能需要在搬家前准备。需要更多信息，请参阅兽医指导之你和你的兽医篇。

Foreign travel and bringing cats to the UK 国际旅行以及把猫带入英国

It is currently illegal to bring a cat to the UK from any country overseas without it either going through quarantine or being imported via the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS). 

未经过隔离并且未经过“宠物迁移体系（PETS）”引进，私自将猫从国外带入英国，是一种违法的行为。

PETS allows pet dogs, cats and ferrets entry to the UK from a number of specified countries without the need for quarantine. Animals entering the UK without a valid pet passport must spend time in quarantine on arrival, until they have complied with the requirement of PETS. 

PETS允许从某一些特定国家引入宠物猫、宠物狗、宠物貂，无需隔离。到达英国的动物如果没有有效的宠物护照，那么就必须在隔离室呆上一段时间，直到它们能够达到PETS的要求。

The process of applying for a pet passport depends on the country the cat will be travelling from. Check the government website www.gov.uk or contact Defra on 0370 241 1710 for concise details. All cats must first be microchipped, then vaccinated against rabies and a blood test may be required. There is then a waiting period of weeks to months before the cat is allowed to travel to the UK. 

申请宠物护照的流程会根据宠物的来源国有所差异。你可以登录政府网站www.gov.uk或者是联系0370 241 1710的Defra来获取简要信息。所有猫都需要首先被植入芯片，之后注射抗狂犬病疫苗。并有可能会被要求做血液检查。之后可能会有一段短则几周，长则几个月的时间，直到你的猫被允许进入英国。

There are specific routes pets must take, whether via air, sea or rail, with approved transport carriers and there are restrictions on the number of pets that may travel. 

无论是乘飞机、轮船或者是火车，宠物入境都有相关的具体路线。而且必须使用被批准过的运输箱。同时入境的宠物数量也有限制。

In the event of a problem with any part of the procedure, the cat may have to go into quarantine pending resolution, so owners should be prepared for further expense. 

如果以上流程任何环节出现问题，猫咪就可能需要进入隔离室等待解决方案。所以主人应该准备好可能的额外开销。

If you are travelling abroad with your cat, as well as fulfilling all the correct requirements for re-entering the UK, remember that you need to fulfil the entry requirements of the country you are visiting. Again, www.gov.uk is the best source of current information. 

如果你要和你的猫出国旅行，不要忘了准备回国需要的所有要求，记住你还需要满足前往国家对宠物入境的所有要求。再次，www.gov.uk是关于此类信息最好的来源。

Before considering a pet passport for your cat, particularly for short-term holidays, think carefully about your cat’s health and behaviour and whether the travel, change of environment, change of climate and potential exposure to exotic diseases will cause your cat unnecessary stress. You may want to consider alternative options, such as a boarding cattery temporarily, or possibly even rehoming your cat. Speak with your vet for advice on your particular cat. 

在考虑为你的猫申请宠物护照之前，对于短期旅行，你需要好好考虑一下你的猫的健康状况以及行为模式。你的旅行、气候变化、环境变化以及可能遇到的外来疾病是不是会给你的猫带来不必要的困扰。你可能需要考虑其他解决方案，比如猫舍短期寄养，或者是交由其他人寄养。对于特定猫咪，和你的兽医沟通获取建议。

Foreign microchips 外来芯片

Whether moving one mile or 10,000 it is vital to update the details stored on your microchip with contact details for the country you are in. In the UK you can do this by contacting Petlog – on 0844 4633 999 or via www.petlog.org.uk – or Anibase – on 01904 487 600 or via www.anibase.com – simply putting your cat through the pet travel scheme or quarantine does not automatically update your records, so it is important that you remember to do this. Your cat may face a further period in quarantine or even euthanasia by the authorities if they become lost, you cannot be traced and their legal entry to the UK cannot be ascertained. For your own records also, keep your cat’s unique microchip number safe. 

无论是移动一公里或者是一万公里，及时更新你所在国家的芯片里的练习人资料都至关重要。在英国你需要联系Petlog（电话0844 4633 999）或者是登录www.petlog.org.uk，你还可以联系Anibase（电话01904 487 600）或者登录www.anibase.com。单纯为你的猫咪办理旅行申请或者是隔离并不会自动更新你的联系人记录。所以一定记得更新。一旦走失，而你无法被联系到，它们合法进入英国的记录也不能被正确获得，那你的猫就可能会面对一段时间的隔离，甚至是被当局安乐死。同样为了你自己的记录完整，一定要妥善保管你猫咪的专有芯片号码。

For more information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guides: Keeping your cat safe and Microchipping. 

需要更多信息，请参照猫咪保护基本指导之保障你猫咪的安全以及芯片植入。

Veterinary care 医学治疗

The veterinary care recommendations in the country you move to may differ from those in the country you have moved from and may depend on the way cats are cared for in those countries and the presence and rate of different diseases seen. For example, vaccination and worming protocols may differ, as may the licensed treatments available. It is important to find yourself a vet in your local area. 

你准备迁入的新国家的兽医治疗，相比较于原来国家的可能会有很多不同。合适的治疗机构可能取决于之前接受到的治疗，以及不同疾病的治疗费用。比如，疫苗接种和驱虫的协议可能有所区别，能够被批准的治疗手段也有区别。在本地找个兽医相当重要。

In the UK, the Find a Vet website page on www.rcvs.org.uk lists your nearest veterinary surgeries that are registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons by postcode. 

在英国，“找兽医网”（www.rcvs.org.uk）上根据邮编罗列了有着皇家兽医学会认证的兽医机构。

It would also be advisable to consider taking out pet insurance and checking whether the policy will offer your cat cover if they are out of their normal country of residence. 

如果你的猫有保险，那么拿出保险条文检查，在境外其是否收到保险保护也相当重要。
