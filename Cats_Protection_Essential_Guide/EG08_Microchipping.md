Microchipping 芯片植入


Microchipping offers cats a safe and permanent method of identification and increases the chances of a lost cat being safely reunited with their owner. 

给猫植入芯片能够安全有效的永久实现对猫的标记，并且增加了猫走失后安全被找回的概率。

Why should cats be microchipped? 为什么猫应该被植入芯片

Microchipping is the most effective way of identifying a lost pet. Microchips don’t come off, or put cats at risk of collar-related injuries. They can also assist with ownership disputes – although please note that a microchip is not absolute proof of ownership, but may be presented as evidence. Each microchip has a unique 15 digit number linked to a database holding your contact details, allowing you to be quickly traced if your cat strays and is scanned for a microchip. 

芯片植入是识别走失宠物最有效的方式。芯片不会丢失，也不会给猫带来因为佩戴项圈可能的风险。同时也能在猫的归属发生争执时候起到作用（尽管不是绝对的证据，但是能够当做证据出示。）每个芯片都有15位的数字编码，对应数据库中你的联系方式。这样一旦当猫流浪并被扫描之后就能很快找到你的联系方式。

The procedure 植入过程

A microchip is slightly smaller than a grain of rice and is inserted under the cat’s skin between the shoulder blades with a dedicated device known as an implanter. The procedure is very simple and is no more painful than an injection. Your cat will not be aware of the microchip’s presence once it has been inserted. 

芯片通常比米粒稍微小一些，并且用一种称为植入器的专用装置注射入肩胛骨之间的皮下。 该过程非常简单，不会比注射更痛苦。 注射植入后，您的猫不会意识到芯片的存在。

How much will it cost? 花费多少？

You can expect to pay around ￡20 to ￡30 for the procedure. 整个植入大概会花费20英镑到30英镑。

Are there ongoing costs associated with microchipping? 芯片植入会不会有后续费用？

If you need to amend your details then a fee is payable to the database. Dependent on the database used, this may be a one-off fee for the lifetime of your cat to cover future updates, or a fee each time you update. Updating contact details is an owner’s responsibility – and is a vital part of the microchip’s value – enabling you to be reunited quickly with your cat should they stray or be lost. 

如果你需要在植入后修改你的联系方式，那可能需要另外给数据库付费。取决于你使用的数据库，付费方式可能是一次付费终身可免费更新信息，也可能是在每次更新信息时候收费。及时更新你的联系方式是主人的责任，同时也是芯片存在的意义，只有这样才能在猫走丢的时候尽快和你团聚。

Who can microchip my cat? 谁能够进行芯片植入？

Vets, local authorities and trained and insured members of animal welfare organisations may offer microchipping. 

兽医、当地动物部门、受过训练的动物福利组织可以提供芯片植入服务。

When should I have my cat microchipped? 什么时候需要植入芯片

There is no minimum age, but it will depend on the preference of the trained implanter. Many cats are microchipped at the time of first or second vaccination but it can also be done at any time after this. It is ideal to get your cat microchipped before letting it outside for the first time. 

芯片植入没有年龄限制，通常取决于植入者的偏好。很多猫会在第一次或者第二次免疫时候被植入芯片，不过在这之后也同样可以进行。理想状态下，你最好是在猫第一次出门前给猫植入芯片。

How will I know my cat’s details have been registered following microchipping? 芯片植入后怎样确定猫的信息已经在数据库登记了？

You will be sent registration documents following the microchipping procedure, usually within a couple of weeks of it taking place. If you don’t receive these, double-check with the person who microchipped your cat. Keep your registration documents and cat’s microchip number safe. 

在芯片植入之后几周后你会收到一封登记成功的文件。如果没有收到，你最好是再确认一下。你需要妥善保存登记文档以及芯片号码。

How do I check my cat’s microchip? 如何检查猫的芯片？

The person implanting the chip will place a hand-held scanner over your cat to check the implantation has been successful. Upon detection of the microchip the scanner will display the microchip’s unique number. Some owners ask to have their cat’s microchip scanned and the microchip checked while having its annual check-up at the vets. While movement of chips or chip failure are extremely rare, it is peace of mind to know the microchip is still working. Microchips are not programmed with global positioning satellite technology so you cannot track your cat’s whereabouts. 

植入芯片的人会在你的猫身上放置一个手持式扫描器来确认植入是否成功。 在检测到微芯片后，扫描仪将显示芯片的唯一编号。 一些主人要求在对兽医进行年度检的同时扫描猫的芯片。虽然芯片移位或芯片故障极为罕见，但确认芯片正常工作是必要的。 芯片没有使用全球卫星定位技术，因此您无法追踪猫的行踪。

What if I lose my cat? 万一猫走失了怎么办？

If you do lose your cat, it is important to double-check with the database that provides the aftercare service for your cat, to ensure your contact details are correct and up to date. If your lost cat is found and taken to a vet, local authority or animal welfare organisation to be scanned, you will be contacted and advised of your cat’s whereabouts. 
如果你的猫真的走失了，你需要再次确认数据库里的自己的联系方式是正确且最新的。一旦猫被找到而且被扫描，就会有人联系你告知猫的所在。

What if I move home or change phone numbers? 搬家或者是更换电话号码后怎么办？

Remember that you should update your cat’s microchip details if you move home or change any of your details – this is essential to ensure you can be traced should your cat stray. 

记住要在搬家或者是任何个人信息发生变化时候及时更新芯片信息。一旦猫走丢，确保自己能够被联系上则至关重要。

This is especially important if you have brought your cat into the UK through the Pet Travel Scheme or through quarantine. If your cat strays with your details still registered overseas and their legal entry to UK cannot be ascertained, your cat face a further period in quarantine or even euthanasia by the authorities if they become lost, you cannot be traced and their legal entry to the UK cannot be ascertained. Simply putting your cat through the pet travel scheme or quarantine does not automatically update your records, so it is important that you remember to do this.

如果你是通过Pet Travel Scheme或者是通过隔离把猫带进英国的，那以下建议则相当重要。如果芯片里的信息仍然是在海外的地址而且其合法入境手续不能被查到。那如果你的猫走失并被抓获，就可能被隔离甚至是安乐死。给猫办理pet travel scheme或者是隔离手续并不会自动更新你的记录，所以及时更新信息很重要。

In the UK, you can update your cat’s registered details by contacting your existing UK database company, or Petlog – on 0844 4633 999 or via www.petlog.org.uk – or Anibase – on 01904 487 600 or via www.anibase.com 

在英国，你可以联系英国数据公司或者是Petlo（电话0844 4633 999、网址www.petlog.org.uk ）或者是Anibase（电话01904 487 600、网址www.anibase.com ）

If you are moving home, you can find further advice in Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Moving house. 

如果你在搬家，阅读猫咪保护基本知道之搬家篇可以找到更多建议。

What if I want to rehome my cat? 如果我想把猫送给别人呢?

Contact your microchip database as transfer of ownership documents should be completed. If your cat is relinquished to a rehoming organisation such as Cats Protection, the organisation will ask for a signed copy of your cat’s microchip registration documents authorising transfer of registered ownership details, or may ask you to complete an alternative form. 

在办理猫咪转移的时候你需要联系你的芯片数据库。如果你的猫被遗弃给了猫咪安置机构（比如Cats Protection），那你可能需要提供猫的芯片登记文档或类似文档来进行登记数据的迁移。

Microchip cat flaps 芯片扫描活页门

If your cat has been microchipped, you may want to consider installing a microchip cat flap in your home. These identify cats trying to enter your home by scanning their microchips and will only allow entry to those whose microchip number you have programmed in to the cat flap. 

如果你的猫已经植入芯片，你可以考虑在家中安装一个芯片扫描活页门。活页门将会扫描尝试进入的猫的芯片，并且只会允许特定猫进入。

Cats Protection and microchipping 

Cats Protection以及芯片植入

All cats and kittens over 12 weeks of age adopted from Cats Protection will already have a microchip as part of the charity’s Minimum Veterinary Standards. We will help you register your contact details with the microchip database at the time of adoption. 

所有从Cats Protection领养的超过一岁龄的猫都已经被植入芯片（这是Cats Protection 最低兽医标准的要求）。我们会在你办理收养手续时帮你注册相关信息到数据库
