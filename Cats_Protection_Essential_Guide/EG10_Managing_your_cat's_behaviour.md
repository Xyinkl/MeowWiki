Managing your cat’s behaviour 
管理猫的行为


Ain’t misbehaving 没有什么行为是错误的

Cats which are nervous, aggressive or act in what we consider is an inappropriate way – such as spraying indoors – behave that way for a reason. These ‘misbehaviours’ are usually signs that something – from the cat’s perspective, at least – is very wrong. Punishing your cat will only make matters worse. It often helps to consider the cat’s normal behaviour, needs and motivations – see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Understanding your cat’s behaviour. Also don’t forget that owners and carers of cats have a legal duty of care to ensure their needs are met, which includes their need to exhibit normal behaviour patterns. 

猫之所以会表现出紧张、攻击性强，甚至是做出室内随便撒尿等被我们认为很不好的行为都是有原因的。这些出格行径通常意味着，从猫的角度来说，有些事情是不对的。一味惩罚你的猫只会让事情更糟糕。
从猫的行为、需求以及驱动上考虑问题通常会很有帮助，具体可以参见猫咪保护基础指导之理解猫的行为。同样，你也需要时刻铭记的是，作为主人和猫的护理者，你需要确保它们的需求得到满足，这些需求包括它们释放天性的那些。

If your cat starts to do something that is out of character, the first thing you should always do is book them in for a heath check with your vet to rule out any medical problems that could cause this behaviour. Medical disorders are very common causes of behavioural issues, even if the link is not immediately apparent. Always discuss the cat s behaviour and all your observations and concerns with the vet. 

如果你的猫出现了任何的出格行为，你需要做的第一件事就是和兽医约定给猫做一次体检，以确保不是因为健康因素造成的这些行为异常。健康问题是导致行为异常的很常见的原因，即便有些时候相对隐蔽。你需要经常和兽医交流你观察到的猫的行为，以及对此产生的忧虑。

Signs of pain 疼痛的症状

Cats are very subtle when it comes to showing pain and they will do their best to hide it. They are more likely to show slight changes in lifestyle or behaviour than they are to show a limp, for example. There are many different medical problems that cause discomfort and varying intensities of pain. Keep a close eye on your cat and if you notice any change in their behaviour, take them to the vets for a health check. Treating pain can really improve their quality of life. 

猫是非常善于隐藏疼痛的动物。举例来说，腿部有恙，它们可能不会表现出任何变化，而不是立刻变的一瘸一拐。很多不同的健康问题都会带来不适甚至是不同程度的疼痛。随时关注猫的一举一动，如果注意到行为的变化，就需要带他们去兽医那里做个体检。止痛能够很大程度上提升它们的生活品质。

Signs of stress 焦虑的表现

Cats express signs of stress in a subtle way making it very difficult to tell when a cat is stressed. There are many reasons why it can occur. Stress as an immediate response to a threat is healthy as it enables the cat’s ‘flight or fight’ response and allows them to get away quickly. However, ongoing stress can be harmful for your cat’s wellbeing. 

猫在焦虑情况下并不会便显出很明显的特征，这使得分辨其焦虑与否相当困难。焦虑的原因可以有很多。焦虑本身能够起到风险预警防御的作用，是面对威胁的良性反应。但是持续的焦虑可能对猫就会有不良的影响了。

A few reasons cats get stressed include moving house or a change in routine such as redecorating or getting new furniture. It can also occur if the litter tray and food bowls are in unsuitable locations, or there aren’t enough. Unfamiliar people visiting the house and the introduction of a new pet, baby or child partner can be a trigger. A cat may be bullied or intimidated by neighbouring cats or even the other resident cats they live with. 

有一些因素会使得猫产生焦虑，这些因素包括搬家、重新装修或者是添置家具。有时因为猫砂盆以及食碗摆放的位置不合适或者不够也会造成猫的焦虑。 同样，陌生人的来访或者是新宠物、新生儿或者儿童的加入都会是焦虑的导火索。猫可能会被邻居的猫甚至是同在一起生活的猫欺负威胁。

Signs to look out for include: 
需要注意的症状包括：

. becoming more withdrawn or hiding more than usual 
· 更为内敛，跟平常相比更喜欢藏起来。

. appear to be sleeping more, some cats will actually pretend to be asleep while trying to monitor the cause of the stress 
· 睡眠增多，有的猫实际上是装睡的同时在监控使其焦虑的事物。

. becoming less tolerant around people or being handled 
· 被人类抱起时候会感到很不耐烦。

. hesitating or becoming more reluctant to use important resources such as window sills, furniture or your lap, using the litter tray or going through the cat flap 
· 在路过窗台、家具、猫砂盆、猫门甚至是你的大腿的时候变的很犹豫抗拒。

. crouching in a hunched up position with squinty eyes, some cats will cringe away from you if you try to approach 
· 蜷缩身体、瞪大双眼，有的猫可能会对你的靠近感到畏惧蜷缩

. a reduction in play behaviour and interaction with owners 
· 玩耍减少并且和主人的互动减少

. eating or drinking less . overeating 
· 饮食减退或者突增

. house soiling 
· 弄脏房间

. over-grooming 
· 过度舔毛


Many of the signs listed for pain and stress could also be due to many other medical conditions or behavioural problems. Always see your vet if you notice any changes in your cat. 

以上很多症状都可能是由健康因素或者是行为问题导致。一旦发现你的猫有不寻常的变化，请联系兽医咨询。

Shy, nervous or timid cats 
害羞、腼腆的猫

While most cats settle into new homes quickly, some remain fearful despite a gentle welcome and time to settle in. Don’t be too disappointed if your shy or timid cat tries run away and hide from you. Showing patience and sensitivity will go a long way to ensure that you have a happy and extremely rewarding relationship with your cat. 

尽管大部分猫能够很快适应新的环境，有些猫可能在被给予妥善的安置足够的时间后仍不能安定下来。如果你的猫腼腆害羞，躲着不肯见你，不要感到失落。保持耐心和敏感度，这样能够最大程度上确保你和你的猫会最后达成友好的关系。

Why is my cat so timid? 
我的猫怎么这么腼腆？

Timid behaviour could be due to: 
腼腆的行为可以是因为：

genetics – an inherited tendency. Some cats are naturally more anxious than others 
基因 - 遗传倾向。有的猫天生就比其他猫更加焦虑

poor socialisation – a lack of contact with humans, particularly during their first eight weeks of life. If young kittens are not properly socialised with people, they will be frightened or stressed by human contact 
糟糕的早期遭遇 - 尤其是在初生的前八周没能够和人类形成良好的互动。如果你的猫没有适应人类的接触，它们就很可能被人类吓到，引发焦虑。

bad experiences – a previous frightening experience that has made the cat fearful 
糟糕的后期经历 - 一些不好的受惊吓的经历会让猫畏惧人类。


What are the signs of shyness, nervousness or timidity? 
猫的内向、害羞、腼腆体现在？

As cats cannot tell us how they feel, it can be difficult to recognise that your cat wants you to move away. Signs of fear include running away and retreating to hiding places. A scared cat will show dilated pupils and/or flattened ears and will cringe and cower from you. 

由于猫不能表达它的感受，所以可能很难分辨猫是不是讨厌你。猫害怕的特征体现在跑开、退缩回隐藏的处所。受惊的猫会表现瞳孔放大、耳朵放平，并且蜷缩身体畏缩远离你。

This fear can develop into aggressive behaviour – where your cat adopts ‘fight’ as a tactic instead of ‘flight’ as a last resort. Usually aggression develops because the cat feels cornered or trapped, or because they have previously learned that flight is unsuccessful. Avoid putting your cat into this situation and ensure they can always get away easily if they want to. 

这种恐惧可能会演变为攻击性行为，也就是猫选择用“战斗”替代“逃跑。猫通常会在感到被围困时候表现出攻击性行为，有时也可能是之前的经历告诉”逃跑“没有好后果。你需要做的是，避免让猫感到被围困，并且确保它想逃离的时候能够轻易逃跑。

Managing shy cats 
如何对待胆小的猫

There are a number of things you can do to make your timid cat feel more secure. As long as your cat had some positive contact with people when they were a young kitten, with patience your cat will learn not to be afraid but you must take things slowly. It helps to: 

有一些措施能够让你的猫感觉更为安全。只要你的猫在幼年时候和人类有正向的互动，耐心对待它这样就一定能消除恐惧。不过要注意的是，一定要放慢速度。

. provide plenty of refuges for your cat around the house. Cats de-stress quicker if they can hide, preferably in high and dark locations eg behind sofas and under beds. A cardboard box on its side or blankets placed on shelves or wardrobes can help your cat feel safe 

· 在屋子里放置足够多的藏匿所。如果能够藏起来，猫会很快从焦躁状态下平复。藏匿所通常是高且昏暗的地点，比如沙发背后或者是窗下。一个纸箱或者是挂在碗柜、书架上的毯子都能够让你的猫感到安全。

. ensure other neighbouring cats cannot enter the house through the cat flap or open windows. Be vigilant to make sure your cat is not being bullied in the garden or intimidated by other cats through the windows, conservatory or patio doors 

· 确保邻居的猫不能够通过活页门或者是敞开的窗户进入到你的猫的领地。对你的猫是否被从窗户、排暖风道、露台进来的猫欺负保持关注。

. keep all your daily routines consistent where possible. This provides a predictable, reassuring environment for your cat 

· 尽量保持作息一致，这样会为你的猫提供一个可以预测、令其安心的环境。

. use synthetic scent pheromones – these can create a reassuring environment for the cat and may help to reduce stress – they are available from your vet 

· 使用合成气味费洛蒙来创造令猫安心的环境，减轻它的焦虑。你可以联系兽医获取费洛蒙。

. sit quietly in your cat’s vicinity to allow them to get used to you in their own time. Ignore them while you read a book or take a nap so that they don’t feel pressurised or anxious about your presence. Do it while they are eating or provide a small treat so they associate your presence with something positive. The time you spend near them can very gradually be built up as they adjust 

· 在猫附近静静的坐着，让它们习惯了你的存在。在读书或者是睡觉的时候不理会它们，这样它们不会因为你的出现而感到焦虑或者是有压力。你可以在它们吃饭时候这样做，或者是在出现的同时给它小点心，这样能够建立正向的反馈。你和它们的呆在一起的时间可以随着它们逐渐适应而加长。


. let your cat make the first move – direct approaches are extremely threatening so don’t force attention on your cat 

· 让你的猫掌握主动——径直靠近一只猫对其是很有压迫的，所以不要强迫它。

. blink slowly at your cat, narrow your eyes so they are half open and then turn your face away slowly to reassure your cat that you are not a threat 

· 对你的猫缓慢的眨眼睛。眯起你的眼睛保持半张的状态，缓慢移开你的脸这样猫才不会把你当作是威胁。

As your cat becomes braver, try: 
如果你的猫胆子大一点了， 你可以尝试：

. talking to your cat quietly in a calming tone – it is a great way to bond 

· 和你的猫用轻柔的语调低语，这样能很好建立联系。

. rewarding your cat with a treat when they approach you – at first, give the treat as soon as your cat approaches but gradually increase the time between the approach and the treat. Over a period of weeks, work up to being able to calmly stroke your cat once or twice before giving the treat 

· 一旦你的猫走向你，可以给它零食奖励。一开始要在它走向你的同时尽快给零食，之后则推迟给零食的时间，几周过后，试着在给猫零食之前挠挠它们的头。

. using small toys you can gently throw for them, such as ball of foil, scrunched up paper or ping pong ball. Fishing rod toys allow the cat to interact without them feeling threatened by close contact 

· 你可以把小的玩具（比如毛线团、揉成的纸团、或者是乒乓球）扔给它们。逗猫棒则可以在让猫不感到近距离威胁的同时让他们和你进行互动。

Most importantly, never lose your temper or try to force your cat to interact too quickly as this will just reinforce their previous fears. Build on your successes gradually – eventually your cat will learn to trust you and will be much happier. In some cases, you may find guidance from your vet or a suitably qualified behaviourist useful. 

最重要的是，永远不要生气，不要试图强制性迫使猫和你快速的进行互动，这样只会加剧它们先天的畏惧。你需要一步一步来，直到你的猫能够信任你并且变的更加快乐。有时候，你可以向兽医或者是动物行为学家请教。

Overcoming a cat’s shyness through patient handling and care often leads to an extremely rewarding and close relationship between owner and cat and is well worth the extra time and effort. 

通过耐心的关爱来帮助猫克服害羞的性格，通常都会很有成效，能够在主人和猫之间建立亲密的关系，是完全值得你付出时间和努力的。


Aggressive cats 具备进攻性的猫

Cats are rarely aggressive towards humans but like all of us, they do have their limits. There are many different reasons for aggressive behaviour and sometimes it can be a combination of causes. Here are just a few examples: 

猫很少会对人类发火，不过像人类一样，有时候也会忍无可忍。进攻性行为可能由多种因素引发，并且有的时候可能是多种因素综合的结果。以下是一些例子：

Defensive/fear aggression –your cat will usually run from a perceived threat but may defend themselves if they can’t escape, or has previously learned that fleeing is unsuccessful. 

防御性、畏惧性的进攻行为--你的猫在面对威胁的时候通常会选择逃跑，但如果无处可逃或者之前有过教训，也会选择自我防卫。

Play and petting aggression – cats generally prefer to have short but frequent interactions, which is normal in feline social etiquette. In contrast, people tend to interact less often but with more intensity. This can be a bit much for some cats and many have a limit when it comes to petting. 

因为玩耍以及爱抚造成的进攻行为--猫通畅喜欢简短、频繁的互动，这是猫科之间通常的社交规矩。与此相反，人类往往会倾向于长时间、低频率的互动，这样对某些猫会是一种压迫。也就是说，猫能够承受的爱抚也是由限度的。



Territorial aggression – usually occurs when two cats meet on disputed ground, or when one cat is passing through another cat’s territory. 

因为领地原因造成的进攻行为--这种情况通常发生在两只猫在某块地域相遇，或者是一只猫正在穿过另一只猫的领地。

Pain-induced aggression – a cat suffering from pain will have drastically reduced tolerance levels and this is a very common reason for aggression. 

因为疼痛导致的进攻行为--正在遭受病痛的猫的忍耐力会急剧缩减，这也是进攻行为的常见原因。

Cats may be more inclined to show aggressive behaviour if they are: 

猫在以下情况更容易表现出进攻行为：

. kept indoors without stimulation, access to essential resources or an outlet for their hunting instinct 

· 被关在家里，没有娱乐方式，不能出门释放狩猎本能，或者是不能获取到关键的资源。

. young 

· 幼猫

. misunderstood by their owner 

· 被主人误解

. not neutered – see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Neutering – family planning for felines for more information 

· 没有做过绝育 - 参见猫咪保护基础指导之绝育篇 - 猫科动物的人口控制方案。


If you have any bites or scratches that break the skin, then clean the wound carefully and seek medical attention. 

如果你被猫咬或者挠破了皮肤，你需要仔细清理伤口并且寻求医学处理。

Spraying and house soiling 喷尿以及随处排泄

Spraying – cats sometimes spray short bursts of urine on vertical objects outside to mark territory and leave information for themselves or other cats to ‘read’. If your cat starts to spray inside the home, then it is almost certainly a sign that all is not right in their world. 

喷尿-猫有的时候会在外面垂直的物体上喷尿，来达到标记领地或者留下交流信息的目的。如果你的猫在家中喷尿，这通常意味着有些事变的不正常了。

Urine spraying is a normal behaviour and can be performed by any cat, whether they are male or female, neutered or not. However, if your cat starts spraying indoors, it can indicate that they do not feel secure in their surroundings. 

喷尿对于猫来说是很正常的行为，任何猫都可能发生，无论其性别、绝育与否。无论如何，如果你的猫在室内喷尿，这意味着它感到周围并不安全。

Urine spraying is a completely different behaviour from normal toileting. When a cat goes to the toilet to rid the body of waste products, they will generally urinate from a squatting position and usually produce a large puddle of urine in a private or secluded area. In contrast, cats will spray urine in order to leave a specific ‘scent message’. When they spray, they will back up to a vertical surface in an open location and squirt a spray of urine from a standing position – sometimes while paddling with the back legs and quivering the tail. 

喷尿和普通的上厕所不一样，是完全不同的行为。当一只猫需要排除身体产生的废物时，它会在隐蔽的地方蹲起身子、排出一摊尿液。与之不同的是，喷尿则意味着猫特意需要制造气味信息。当猫喷尿时，它们会背对一个垂直的平面，站着射出一道尿液，有的时候还会弓起尾巴，用后腿拍打尿液。

Why does my cat urine spray? 为什么我的猫会喷尿？

Urine spraying is a normal part of scent marking behaviour. Cats use scent to identify different areas in their territory – this provides them with a ‘scent map’ of their environment as they move around. For example, cats tend to rub their cheeks in the ‘core’ part of their territory where they feel safe and relaxed. In contrast, they use urine spray to mark areas of their territory where they feel threatened. It is thought that the scent deposited acts as a ‘reminder to self’ for the cat to be wary in that part of his or her territory. When the smell begins to fade, the cat will re-spray to top it up. 

喷尿是进行气味标记的正常行为，猫利用气味在它的领地中区分不同范围。这样它就能利用“气味地图“分辨自己所在的区域。举例来说，猫会用脸颊摩擦领地中让它感到安全放松的核心区域。于此相反的是，它会在自己感受到威胁的区域用喷尿的方式做标记。这种气味被认为是猫给自己设置的”警惕信息“。当这种气味开始消散的时候，猫会重新喷尿来维持气味。

Why is my cat urine spraying indoors? 
为什么我的猫在室内喷尿？

Cats may spray indoors when they are: 
猫在以下情况中可能会在室内喷尿：

. ill 
· 生病

. stressed by a perceived threat 
· 来自已经感知到的威胁的压力

. stressed by changes in the household eg new baby or building work 
· 因为家庭中变化、新生儿、建筑施工而带来的压力

. threatened by other cats coming into the household, or by cats in the surrounding neighbourhood – this is the most common reason 
· 被新来的猫威胁，或者是被隔壁的猫威胁。这个原因最为常见。


Often there is a combination of factors that have led to the development of urine spraying. In some cases, the behaviour can start for one reason and develop or change due to other causes. For example, many owners punish their cat for spraying in the house – this tends to make the cat more anxious and more likely to spray. The best thing you can do is identify what is worrying your cat and address it. 

通常来说，喷尿都是很多因素渐进组合的结果。在某些案例中，这种行为可能因为某些原因开始，又因为其他原因而改变或者是加剧。举例来说，很多主人会因为猫在家中喷尿而惩罚猫，这样会使得猫更加焦虑，也更容易喷尿。你能做的最恰当的应对，就是找出造成猫焦虑的原因，并且解决它。

What can I do if my cat sprays indoors? 如果猫在室内喷尿，我应该怎么做？

If your cat has suddenly started spraying indoors, you should take your cat to have a health check with your vet to ensure there is no underlying medical cause for the behaviour. If the vet deems your cat is healthy, the next stage is to find out what the cat finds threatening and then take action to stop it. This process can be quite complicated, as there are often many factors involved. It is best to ask your vet to refer you to a suitably qualified behaviourist 

如果你的猫突然出现了在室内喷尿的行为，你应该首先带它到兽医处检查一下是不是存在着潜在的健康问题。如果兽医的检查结果证明你的猫健康没有问题，那下一阶段就是要找出使猫感到威胁的原因，并且消除。这个过程可能会很复杂，因为通常情况下干扰因素有很多。最好是请兽医给你印件一位适合的你的猫的情况并且有相关资质的动物行为学家。

Sometimes, spraying can be more easily linked to a specific change in the environment. For example, the addition of a new cat to the household can threaten resident cats and induce spraying. Clues about why your cat has started spraying can be ascertained from the location of the marks, because these will be left specifically where they feel anxious. 

有的情况下，喷尿往往和环境中明显的变化有关。举例来说，新猫加入往往会威胁到原住的猫并诱导其喷尿。你可以从其喷尿的位置探究其喷尿的具体原因。其喷尿的位置通常会是其感受到焦虑的位置。

If they are spraying on internal doorways and in hallways it may be because this is where they come into close contact with other cats in the household. To overcome this, you can help to prevent conflict and create a sense of security by providing extra litter trays, bowls and places for your cats to sleep, play and scratch – reducing the need for competition. If your cats have to walk past each other because of the layout of your house, you can put up shelving or arrange furniture so they can pass each other at different levels, without direct contact. 

如果它们在门廊或者门厅喷尿，那可能是因为这些区域是它们和家中其他猫接触的地方。如果是这种情况，你可以通过提供额外的猫砂盆、食盆以及休息的场所来减少其休息、玩耍时可能产生的竞争，为你的猫营造安全感。如果因为家中的布局，你的猫们不可避免的会相互穿越，那你可以设置一些架子以及家具，使其能够在不同的路径中穿行，避免直接的接触。

What can I do if my cat sprays on doors and windows? 猫在门以及窗户上喷尿，我该怎么做？

If your cat is spraying on the cat flap, external doors or windows then it is usually because something outside is worrying them – for example other cats they can see through windows. In this case, making the inside environment feel more secure for them is often helpful. Covering the windows with a semi-transparent material to restrict their view of other cats outside may help. If other cats are entering the house through your cat flap, you can fit a microchip cat flap that reads your cat’s unique microchip, or a magnetic cat flap – where a magnet is attached to a safety collar. You could also try to discourage the neighbouring cats from entering the garden, see humane deterrents for ideas. 

如果你的猫在猫活页门、通向外部的大门或者是窗户上喷尿，这通常意味着外部有东西让它们感到威胁。举例来说，可能是它们透过窗户能够看到的，其他外面的猫。在这种情况下，把内部的环境变得更加安全往往很有帮助。你也可以在窗户上覆盖半透明膜，减少它们的视野，这样同样会有所帮助。如果其他猫会通过活页门进入家中，那你可以安装一种能够识别芯片的活页门，这种活页门只能识别你的猫的芯片。你也可以用磁性的活页门，同时采用带有磁铁的猫颈圈。你同样需要避免邻居的猫进入到花园中来，可以通过人造威慑素来驱逐外面的猫。

The importance of scent 气味的重要性

Redecorating, changing furniture or moving house removes familiar smells that comfort your cat. To prevent your cat from becoming anxious at unfamiliar scents, it is a good idea to introduce them to a new environment or house gradually. When moving into a new house, keeping your cat in one room with items familiar to them and then gradually allowing access to other areas will help to decrease their anxiety. Also see What is pheromone therapy? later. 

重新装修、更换家具或者是搬家都会消减能够使你的猫感到安全的气味。为了不造成猫的焦虑，你可以逐渐的让其提前适应新环境。搬入新家的时候，先把猫留在一个放有熟悉味道的屋子里。 之后逐渐的允许其扩大活动范围。这样能够减弱它们的焦虑。或者你也可以考虑费洛蒙方案。

Inappropriate toileting 排泄异常

Inappropriate toileting is different to spraying behaviour and can occur for completely different reasons. If your cat is toileting away from the litter tray, there are many different reasons. Always get your cat vet checked before considering any behavioural interventions, as it is very important to rule out medical reasons for the behaviour. Below are some general guidelines that may help, but if you have all these measures in place and the problem persists, it is worth getting a referral to a qualified behaviourist to help identify the causes. 

排泄异常和喷尿行为不同，可能由完全不同的因素导致。如果你的猫不在猫砂处排泄，可能是很多原因导致。记得在进行行为干涉之前一定要带猫去做体检排除健康问题。以下是一些常见的指导方案，如果你尝试了以下所有的措施但问题仍然存在，那么还是需要另外请动物行为专家来确定问题出在哪里，并解决。

Even if your cat has outside access, always provide litter trays inside. Some cats can feel safer using a tray in the house – there could be neighbourhood cats that intimidate them. Understandably, many cats don’t like to go out when it’s bad weather, or if the toileting site is frozen over in winter and it’s difficult to dig. 

即便你的猫能够自由外出，你也需要在室内为其准备猫砂盆。有的猫可能会感觉在室内排泄更安全，因为外部可能会有邻居的猫会造成威胁。同样合乎情理的是，很多猫在天气不好的时候不喜欢去外面排泄。当冬天土地冻冰的时候，会很难挖。

Privacy 

Toileting is a very vulnerable activity for cats and they will try to choose a quiet, private location for this. If your cat is upset by an incident outside, or near to their litter tray, they may instead find a quiet corner indoors to pass their waste. If the tray is positioned in the open where it may be disturbed, the cat may feel too vulnerable to use it and will seek a safer spot instead. A tray may not be used if it is placed next to a noisy washing machine, or by a cat flap and remember that cats like to toilet away from where they eat and drink. When placing litter trays, put them in quiet, private areas that are away from busy walkways. 

Litter tray 

There are many different types of litter trays available to suit your cat’s needs. As a kitten grows up, they will need a larger, adult-sized tray with enough space to manoeuvre. An elderly cat requires a tray with low sides so they can get in and out more easily. Nervous cats may prefer the privacy of hooded litter trays. Each cat is an individual and what might work for one cat, won’t necessarily work for another. As a general rule, provide one litter tray per cat, plus an extra one. If you are experiencing litter tray problems, you may need to add a few extra trays to this rule. Place the trays in a variety of different locations around the home, both upstairs and downstairs, as opposed to placing them next to each other in a row. 


Litter 

Cats often prefer the litter type they used as a kitten. Many cats have a preference for fine, heavy sand-like litter, which is similar to the material that their ancestors would have used. This feels soft under their paws and enables them to have a good dig. Avoid anything scented as cats have a very sensitive sense of smell – although you might like the fragrance, your cat may not agree! Provide 3cm of litter as this generally seems to be the preferred depth for cats – not too shallow so they can have a good dig in it, but equally they don’t like it too deep either. 

Cleanliness 

Cats are renowned for their fastidiously clean nature so they will not use a dirty litter tray. Remove any deposits once or twice a day if you have a clumping litter and completely clean out the tray once a week. Some cats prefer the deposits to be removed before they will use the tray again, while others prefer one tray for urinating and another for defecating. Hooded litter trays need to be kept extra clean as they can hold the smell inside and be overpowering for your cat’s keen sense of smell! 

Never punish for spraying or inappropriate toileting 

Although urine spraying or inappropriate toileting can be an unpleasant and distressing problem, you should never punish your cat. They are spraying because they feel anxious – punishing them will only make them more likely to spray due to stress. The best thing you can do is to identify what is worrying your cat and address this, starting with a visit to your vet for a health check. 

How do I clean urine from affected areas? 

Once a cat has sprayed, if the area is not cleaned appropriately, their sensitive nose will draw them back to spray the same area again in an attempt to top up the faded scent. Many household cleaning products contain ammonia which is also found in cat urine, so using these can make the problem worse. 

A cheap and efficient cleaning method is to wash sprayed or soiled sites thoroughly with a warm, 10 per cent solution of biological washing powder and then rinse with clean water and allow the area to dry. If the surface is suitable, surgical spirit can be applied after cleaning to remove all lingering traces of urine. It is worth doing a small patch test first to ensure this cleaning regime will not cause any damage. 

Carpet is extremely absorbent and the urine often soaks into the underlay and the flooring underneath. If the area is badly soiled over a long period it may be necessary to cut out the section of carpet and underlay and treat the concrete or floorboards underneath before replacing. 


Scratching 

Scratching is a normal behaviour. Cats scratch for two reasons; to keep their claws in good condition and as a communication signal. Scent glands in between the pads of the paws produce a unique smell, which is deposited on the surface that the claws are dragged down. This scent, combined with the visual signal of the scratch marks and discarded claw husks, leaves a reminder signal for the cat and a message for other felines in the area. 

Why is my cat scratching indoors? 

If your cat has limited or no access to the outdoors – either through their own choice or yours – they will have to maintain good claw condition inside the house. They will find one or two suitable scratching sites and continue to use them, whether this is a cat scratching post or the back of your settee! 

If the scratched areas are widespread throughout your home including areas of conflict like doorways and windows, it is likely that your cat is scratching for communication reasons and feels insecure in these areas. Just like spraying, the most common reason for scratching indoors is the presence of another cat. 

The reason for cats to show this behaviour can change over time. If your cat enjoys attention, they might learn that whenever they scratch the furniture you interact with them, so they will carry on scratching. 

What can I do if my cat scratches the furniture? 

If your cat is scratching furniture or wallpaper to maintain their claws you could: 

. protect the scratched item by covering with thick, shiny plastic sheeting  as this is unappealing to cats 

. at the same time, obtain a suitable scratching post and put it next to the area where they scratch 

. choose a scratching post with a heavy base so it doesn’t topple over or wobble when in use. It should be tall enough to allow your cat to scratch at full stretch – ensure it has a vertical weave to let them drag their claws downwards 

. some cats prefer to scratch horizontally (eg cats that scratch carpets or stairs) or diagonally so provide a scratching mat to meet these needs 

. once your cat is consistently using the new post, you can gradually move it to a more convenient location if you wish and then remove the plastic sheeting from the furniture or wallpaper 

. cats often like to scratch and stretch after they wake up, so you could try placing the scratch post near your cat’s bed 


Each cat in a household should have a scratching post – positioned in different locations to prevent conflict. Some posts are impregnated with catnip, or you could try rubbing quality catnip on the scratch post to entice them – placing pieces of food on the post may also help. Playing with your cat little and often throughout the day and providing toys may help redirect their energy away from scratching. 

Scratching to mark territory 

If your cat is scratching furniture as a marking behaviour, then try to identify what is worrying the cat in this part of their territory and remedy it – see spraying section above. Follow the advice already given and cover the scratched areas with a protective material and place a scratching post next to them. However, to help your cat to feel secure in their surroundings and permanently stop them scratching the furniture, you will need to identify and deal with what is worrying them. Don’t just provide them with another scratching surface without attending to their feelings of insecurity. You may need guidance from a suitably qualified behaviourist to help identify the cause of their anxiety. 

Importance of praise 

It is important to remember that cats do not scratch just to be naughty. It is a natural behaviour they should be allowed to exhibit. Shouting when your cat scratches your furniture can lead to an increase in frequency as they become more anxious, or learns that scratching can be used for attention seeking. Cats quickly learn that unwanted clawing gets a reaction, but clawing a scratching post doesn’t. Make sure you praise your cat when they claw the scratching post and try not to react if they scratch the furniture. 



Humane deterrents for cats 

The Animal Welfare Act 2006 – including the Scottish and Northern Irish equivalents – gives all cats legal protection. For more information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Cats and the law. For those who wish to avoid having cats visit their garden, the following advice may be useful. 
. Shoo a cat away by either shouting or clapping your hands when you see them enter your garden 

. Squirt water near the cat using a low-powered water pistol – not a super-soaker – being careful to avoid their eyes. Most cats hate water. 

. Install an automatic garden spray, triggered by an infra-red detector which locates movement 

. Erect high, close-boarded fences next to the hedges in the garden, making it difficult for cats to visit 

. Avoid leaving food for birds and other wildlife in places that are easily accessible to cats and ensure dustbin lids are secure. In addition, do not start feeding a cat if you do not want them around as this will encourage the cat 

. Cultivate shrubs closely to prevent cats from finding a place to dig. Spread chicken manure around beds and borders, taking care to use Soil Association approved pellets rather than fresh manure 

. Consider covering parts of the garden that you do not want the cat to toilet in with stone chippings, pebbles or small rocks 

. Lion dung-infused pellets, the planting of coleus canina and crushed egg shells have been used with varying levels of success to deter cats from toileting in flower beds 


Hardy plants and the use of tall planters in strategically placed positions – eg entrances and protruding corners – can help to reduce the effects of cats marking their territory through spraying by encouraging them to use the plants. 

Using ‘home-made’ or shop bought deterrents which could harm or injure a cat may be considered an offence under animal welfare legislation for causing unnecessary suffering, so bear this in mind when considering deterrents. 


What is pheromone therapy? 

Cats deposit pheromones (which are chemical signals of communication to themselves or other cats) from glands on their faces when rubbing objects such as the corners of walls or furniture. They leave behind different messages, one of these facial pheromones tells the cat that they are in an area they recognise and are safe. Cats regularly re-mark with these pheromones as they go around their home. You can buy a synthetic version of this facial pheromone – Feliway. - to help your cat during times of stress. Feliway provides on-going support and comfort to cats reassuring them and marking the area as safe and secure. It is available from your vet or from the Cats Protection online pet shop – see www.catsprotectionshop.co.uk. It is available as a plug-in diffuser, which lasts up to four weeks, continuously releasing the comforting pheromone into the local environment, and a spray, that can be used around the home or when travelling, lasting up to 24 hours. Alternatively, you can try using a clean cotton cloth or glove to gently rub on your cat’s cheeks to collect the pheromone – and then rub this around on surfaces at cat height, such as onto new furniture, so that it smells familiar. Remember that the pheromone will need to be topped up regularly, until your cat either rubs its cheeks on the item or shows relaxed behaviour. Feliway can be a great support tool for helping stressed cats, however it is always recommended to rule out medical conditions first with your vet and it is important that the reason for your cat’s anxiety is also identified and dealt with. If your cat has a behavioural problem, then it is recommended to get a referral from your vet to a qualified behaviourist such as a member of the Association of Pet Behaviour Counsellors (www.apbc.org.uk). 

Help is at hand 

The advice given in this leaflet is aimed at encouraging positive behaviours and helping with some behavioural issues. However, it is not individually tailored to a specific cat and the development of behaviours in each cat is unique. The cause of a problem can sometimes be difficult to identify, particularly if it is complex or there are a number of contributing factors. If your cat has a behavioural problem, it is recommended to discuss the problem with your vet who can refer you to a suitably qualified behaviourist, such as a member of the Association of Pet Behaviour Counsellors (www.apbc.org.uk) or a Certified Clinical Animal Behaviourist (CCAB) that can be found through the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour (ASAB) at http://asab.nottingham.ac.uk/ . Seek help sooner rather than later as it can be more difficult to rectify long-standing issues. Luckily many problems can be resolved, allowing you to enjoy positive companionship with your cat once more. 

Happy relationships 

Cats Protection has a clear vision of a world where every cat is treated with kindness and an understanding of its needs. What makes a cat unique is the very reason why they are so well loved. With a little understanding of your cat’s background, behaviours and needs, you can prevent any problems that may arise and enjoy sharing your life a happy cat.
