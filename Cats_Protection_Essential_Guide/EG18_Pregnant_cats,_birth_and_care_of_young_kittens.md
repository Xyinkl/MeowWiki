Pregnant cats, birth and care of young kittens 
孕猫、生产以及幼猫护理

Cats Protection (CP) recommends neutering as the only effective way to reduce the number of unwanted cats in the UK. Cats are prolific breeders and their offspring need to be speedily neutered or the population will quickly get out of control. In fact, one female cat can be responsible for a staggering 20,000 descendants in just five years! In spite of CP assisting the neutering of over 175,000 cats in the UK each year, there are still thousands of unwanted cats and kittens in animal charities up and down the country needing loving homes. 

绝育是减少多余猫咪数量唯一有效的途径，Cat Protection (CP)建议绝育。猫的繁衍能力很强，它们的下一代往往也需要尽快绝育，否则就会很快数量失控。事实上，一只母猫在短短五年内可能就会产生超过20000只后代。除了CP每年协助进行绝育的175000只英国境内的猫，全国的收容站上下还有几千只流浪猫无家可归。

Feline reproduction 猫科的繁衍

Female cats – queens – can become sexually mature from just four months of age. If queens are not neutered they have regular heat cycles showing restlessness, calling and wailing, squirming, rubbing and presenting the rear, in attempts to attract a mate. These periods of reproductive activity lasting a few days recur every few weeks during the breeding season – which usually runs from February until August. During these heat cycles, a queen will be very attractive to unneutered male tom cats which can detect her scent from several miles away and will make great efforts to reach her. 

雌性猫，也就是母猫最早可能在四个月大的时候就达到性成熟。如果没有绝育，它们会定期表现出烦躁、嘶吼、摩擦地面等求偶行为。这种繁衍的行为会在每个哺乳季节（通常是二月到八月）隔几周就出现几天。在这段时期，母猫会对未经过绝育的公猫产生很强的吸引，后者能在几公里外感知到它的味道，并且披荆斩棘来和它交配。

Queens are not selective in their choice of mate and will accept advances made by any tom, including relatives. Allowing an unneutered female unsupervised time outside – or indoors with an unneutered tom – will inevitably put her at risk of pregnancy as well as putting both her and any resulting kittens at risk of the infectious diseases that unneutered roaming toms may carry. 

母猫在配偶选择上不具选择性，任何公猫先到先得，其近亲也不例外。把未经绝育的母猫和未绝育公猫放在一起，会不可避免的将母猫置于怀孕的风险中，也会给母猫和可能的小猫带来公猫身上可能的传染病。

Contrary to popular belief, there are no health or welfare benefits in allowing a cat to have a litter of kittens before 
she is neutered and providing appropriate care can be costly and time consuming. 

和流行的看法相悖的是，让母猫在绝育之前有一群小猫并不会对其健康或者是生活质量有任何提高。随之而来的幼猫护理则相当昂贵耗时。

Pregnancy (Gestation) and care of the pregnant queen 
怀孕以及孕猫护理

Pregnancy lasts approximately 63-65 days – around nine weeks. 
猫的孕期持续大概63到65天，也就是九周左右。

Heat cycles usually stop after mating once a cat becomes pregnant, although sometimes they will continue. If mating occurs again during the pregnancy this can lead to further foetuses being conceived and kittens born with different fathers in the same litter! 

在怀孕后，猫通常会停止发情，不过也偶有例外。如果在怀孕后继续交配，则会产生更多的胚胎着床，在同一窝小猫中会有同母异父的情况发生。

Pregnancy can be diagnosed by the vet using abdominal palpation from around three to four weeks of age or by using ultrasound. Pinking up – enlargement and reddening of the teats – may be seen from around three to four weeks of pregnancy. 

猫怀孕三至四周后，兽医经过腹部触摸就能确认，或者是超声波验孕。乳头变粉、涨大、等现象也会在怀孕三四周起出现。

Behaviour changes may be seen in the last week of pregnancy. Queens may appear to search for a suitable place to give birth. Ideally, pregnant queens should be introduced to a quiet, clean and warm kittening area away from the family and other pets at least two weeks before the expected date for birth. Provide warm blankets and clean sheets that can be washed and replaced as necessary. 

在孕期最后一周，母猫可能出现性格转变，往往会开始寻找能够生产的地方。理想状态下，孕猫应该在预产期之前两周被安置在远离其他宠物、安静、温暖、清洁的地方。定期给孕猫替换并清洗温暖的毯子以及床单。

The queen will need to eat more than usual, especially in the last three to four weeks of pregnancy when she needs approximately 25 per cent more food. Feed her kitten food in regular meals. This feeding regime should continue through lactation until the kittens are weaned – queens use more than double their normal energy requirements when suckling kittens. Pregnant, birthing and lactating queens should have access to plenty of water, but during and after birth this must be safely out of kittens’ reach to avoid them drowning. 

母猫在怀孕期间需要吃比平时更多的食物，尤其是在最后三四周，它需要比平时多四分之一的食物。你需要给母猫喂食幼猫猫粮，直到小猫断奶。哺乳期间，母猫会需要超过平时两倍的营养。处在孕期、产期、授乳期的母猫应该能够摄入足量清水。不过在生产期和授乳期则应该注意不要让小猫接近水盆以免溺水。

It is advisable to seek veterinary advice before allowing your cat to breed when it is important to discuss fitness to breed and vaccination. If your cat is already pregnant, seek advice about the specific care of your cat, including feeding and worming your cat and treating it for fleas. Ensure you use treatments which are safe for use during pregnancy. 

在允许你猫进行生育之前，你最好咨询一下兽医，因为生育可能涉及免疫等健康方面的问题。如果你的猫已经怀孕了，那么你需要咨询孕期卫视、除虫的相关问题。一定要确保你用的药物是适宜在孕期使用的。

Neutering during pregnancy can be performed and is best discussed with your own vet. You may wish to discuss neutering your cat following an unwanted mating or where there are significant health risks to the queen and/or the kittens. 

孕期进行绝育也是可行的，不过最好是资讯你的兽医。当母猫意外怀孕或者是母猫以及小猫的健康受到威胁时，你往往就要考虑绝育了。

Birth and kittening 生产

The secret of being a good midwife to your cat is observation and timing. It is best to watch the cat quietly from a distance, taking care not to disturb her or make her anxious. Contact a vet if any problems occur. Birth, also called parturition or kittening, is divided into three stages, and the second and third stages are repeated for each kitten. Please note, this leaflet offers some guidance, but is no substitute for specific veterinary advice from your own vet. 

做好猫咪接生婆的奥秘在于仔细的观察以及时机的把握。你应该在远处静静观察母猫，小心谨慎的不打扰母猫，使其产生焦虑。如果有意外发生，联系你的兽医。生产，也叫做分娩，被分为三个阶段。后两个阶段会在每个小猫降生时重复发生。需要注意的是，本文所提供的一些建议仅供参考，具体更应该听从你兽医的具体建议。

First stage – lasts up to 36 hours – and is usually shorter in queens which have had kittens before: 

d第一阶段最长会持续36小时，之前生产过的母猫这一阶段会短一点。

. there are intermittent contractions, but NO straining is seen 

·有断断续续的宫缩，但是没有使劲的现象。

. the queen is restless and there are usually repeated visits to the bed 

·母猫表现出焦躁不安，频繁进出猫窝。

. late in the first stage, some scratching of the bedding and panting may be seen 

·第一阶段后期，有些猫可能会出现大喘气、挠床的现象。

. vaginal discharge is rare  阴道排泄物较少

Second stage – lasts five to 30 minutes for each kitten: 

第二阶段对于每个小猫会持续三十分钟左右：

. there are stronger contractions 

·很强力的宫缩

. the foetal membranes – water bag – appear briefly at the vulva and burst. Liquid is usually cleared up by the cat 

·胚胎薄膜，也就是羊水囊，出现在外阴并且凸出。羊水通常会被母猫清理干净。

. active straining starts and the kitten usually comes out head first 

·收缩开始，小猫的头通常会先出来。

. once the head is out, one or two strains from the cat should expel the kitten 

·一旦头露出，接下来的一两次收缩就会把小猫完全挤出。

. the mother breaks the bag and chews through the cord and licks the kitten – this cleans it and encourages it to start to breathe 

·母猫会弄破羊水囊，吃掉脐带，并且舔舐幼猫。这样不光清理了幼猫，也使其开始呼吸。

Third stage – passage of the membranes and dark flesh mass of the placenta or afterbirth: 

第三阶段，羊水囊以及胎盘的处理。

. this usually follows immediately, although occasionally two kittens are born followed by two sets of membranes 

·这一阶段通常会立刻发生，不过有的情况下两只小猫同时降生则会延缓这一阶段。

. try to count the number of placentae to ensure one is passed for each kitten. If they are not all passed within four to six hours, veterinary advice should be sought. Bear in mind, the queen will usually eat the placenta to hide evidence of the birth and protect her offspring 

·清点胎盘数量，确保每只小猫的胎盘都被排出。如果四至六小时后胎盘仍没有完全排出，你应该咨询兽医的意见了。

. a red-brown vaginal discharge may be seen for up to three weeks after the birth. It is abnormal if it is green or foul smelling – although there may normally be a small amount of greenish discharge after the kitten or placenta 

` 生产后三周内都可能出现红棕色引导排泄物。尽管在幼猫或者胎盘排出后可能会有少量绿色排泄物，不过如果排泄物是绿色或者有恶臭则是不正常的，。

Time between delivery of kittens is usually 10 to 60 minutes and stages two and three are repeated. The birth is usually complete within six hours after the start of the second stage, but can last up to 12 hours. 

生产每只幼猫的间隔大约为10分钟至一小时，然后第二第三阶段就会重复发生。一旦第二阶段开始，整个生产过程通常会在六小时内完成，不过也有持续十二小时的案例。

Between one and nine kittens will be born in a litter – most commonly four to six. First-time queens usually have a small litter size. When the birth is finished the mother will settle and allow the kittens to feed. 

母猫一窝会生一到九只幼猫，通常情况下会生四到六只。初次生产的母猫生的幼猫会少一点。生产过程结束之后，母猫会安定下来，给幼猫喂奶。

Have clean towels, a hot water bottle, a feeding bottle or syringe and some specialist substitute cat milk replacement 
– not cow or goat milk – ready in advance. If everything goes well, leave the cat alone, but ensure she has access to food and water and a litter tray, without any risk of the kittens becoming trapped or drowning. 

事先准备好干净的毛巾、一瓶热水、喂奶的瓶子或者是注射器，以及猫奶的替代品（不能使牛奶或者是羊奶）。如果一切顺利，你需要让母猫自己处理这一切，不过要确保而能够自由进食、饮水，以及如厕，同时不会让幼猫有绊住或者是淹死的危险。


What can go wrong with the birth? 生产过程中可能会出现什么问题？

In most cases the cat will manage without any help, with kittens born five to 30 minutes after a queen starts actively straining. Discreet and quiet observation is ideal. However, difficult births can occur and here are some things you can do to help:

通常情况下母猫不需要任何帮助就能生产，在开始收缩的5到30分钟内就能把小猫生出来。你只需要安静的仔细观察即可，不过，难产的情况也可能发生，以下是发生难产时你能够做的：

. seek veterinary advice if you have any concerns

· 如果你有任何担忧，及时联系兽医咨询建议

. if a kitten is seen partly out, but the mother is very tired and the kitten isn’t passed within a few seconds, you can gently try to pull it out by pulling downwards with clean hands, but be very gentle and seek veterinary advice 

· 如果一只幼猫的部分已经排出，但是母猫已经无力继续生产。你可以试着用干净的手慢慢把幼猫拉出来。注意要很轻柔，而且尽量咨询兽医的建议。

. if the mother does not clean the kitten, you can quickly and quietly clear the membranes from its head with clean, soft kitchen roll. Wipe its nose and open the mouth to clear it. Rub the kitten in small circular movements to get it breathing 

· 如果母猫没有清理她的幼崽，你可以用厨房纸快速轻柔地把幼猫头上的薄膜清理干净，擦干净它的鼻子以及嘴巴。循环按压小猫使其开始呼吸。

. if the mother does not bite through the cord, you can tie it off twice with clean sewing thread around 3cm from the kitten’s body and gently tear between the two ties. Clean hands are essential 

· 如果母猫没有咬断期待，你可以用干净的缝纫线在距离幼猫3厘米的脐带部分打两个结，并在两个结之间轻柔地扯断脐带。如此操作，一定要保持手部的清洁。

. provide warmth if the mother is avoiding the kittens – a warm, well covered hot water bottle 

· 如果母亲不照顾、疏离小猫，那你需要提供更温暖的环境，比如一个包裹严实的热水瓶。

. if you’ve had to intervene at all, it is best to seek veterinary advice straight away, as the kittens may be more at risk of infection or being mismothered – being injured or rejected and not suckled or kept warm by the queen 

· 如果你不得不进行干预，最好马上寻求兽医的建议，因为小猫可能更容易感染或被母猫疏离，它可能会被母猫伤害或拒绝抚育，不被授乳或者是不再被母猫维持体温。

An owner should call the vet for advice during the birth: 

生产过程中出现以下情况人应该打电话咨询兽医意见：

. if the first stage is lasting longer than 24 hours without any sign of straining 

· 如果第一阶段持续超过24小时切没有任何收缩的迹象

. if the cat has been straining for more than 30 minutes without producing anything, as this could indicate an obstruction eg a very large kitten 

· 如果母猫已经收缩超过三十分钟但仍然没有排出任何东西，这可能意味着有一个很大的幼猫。

. if the first kitten has arrived and no further kittens appear after an hour 

· 如果第一个幼猫已经产出，但是一小时后还没有其他幼猫产出的。

. if the cat suddenly seems weak 

· 如果母猫突然显示出无力症状

. if there is excessive bloody discharge or greenish discharge without a kitten. However, there may be a greenish discharge after the kitten or with the afterbirth 

· 如果在没有幼猫产出的情况下存在大量的带血排泄物或者是绿色的排泄物。

. if a kitten is stuck half-way out and cannot be delivered with gentle traction 

· 如果幼猫在排出过程中被卡住并且轻柔拽动也不能排出的。

In some cases, a caesarean section may be required to deliver the kittens. 

有些情况下，可能需要剖腹产才能把幼猫产出。

Things you can do after the birth 生产完毕后你能做的事

Warmth is very important as newborn kittens lose heat very quickly. If the mother is an attentive one, she will clean them and use her own body heat to keep the kittens warm. If she is very tired or disturbed she may ignore them, in which case heat must be supplied, via a heat pad or a covered hot water bottle – no hotter than body temperature – and the kittens should be covered with a light towel or blanket. Keep the room temperature warm and the bedding clean and dry. The kittens should start to suck from their mother almost immediately. If they haven’t started after half an hour gently guide them towards the teats. If they don’t start feeding, consult your vet and you may need to start giving a substitute milk replacer to the kitten – follow the instructions carefully. Remember, newborn kittens cannot go more than a few hours without milk. 

新生幼猫会很快丧失体温，所以保暖相当重要。如果母猫很负责任，它会清理小猫并且用自己的体温来保持幼猫温暖。如果它太累或者是收到惊吓则可能不会这么做，这时额外的热源必须由人来提供。可以用加热毯或者是包裹完全的热水瓶，温度不能超过体温。幼猫应该用轻薄的毛巾或者是毯子盖住。保持室温温暖，产窝清洁干燥。小猫应该很快从母猫身上吸奶。如果在半小时后还没有开始，那你需要轻轻地引导它们找到奶头。如果他们没有开始吸吮，请咨询你的兽医，你可能需要开始给小猫提供猫奶的替代品。请仔细按照说明进行。请记住，新生小猫在没有吸奶的情况下生存不会超过几个小时。

If the queen is calm and settled you may wish to quickly and quietly check each kitten. Speak to your vet for advice and if you have any concerns. 

如果母猫情绪稳定，那你可以快速安静的检查每只小猫。如果有任何问题，你都需要咨询兽医的意见。

The queen should be carefully monitored following the birth. Veterinary advice should be sought if any problems are noted. These may include: 

幼猫出生后你应该仔细观察母猫。如果发现任何问题，应寻求兽医建议。这些问题可能包括：

. bleeding from the vagina or unusual vaginal discharge 

· 阴道出血或不正常的阴道分泌物

. prolapse of the uterus (womb) – straining can occasionally cause the uterus to be pushed out 

· 子宫脱垂 - 紧张有时会导致子宫被推出

. disturbed behaviour – normally queens spend most of the time with the litter for at least two weeks and are usually very calm after the birth. However, some queens may show disturbed behaviour: 

· 不安的行为 - 通常女王大多数时间都会在小猫附近度过至少两周的时间，并且在生产后通常很平静。但是，一些母猫可能会表现出不安的行为：

. severe disturbance, constant interruptions or pain can cause the queen to kill her offspring. The risk of this is reduced if mum is familiar with her environment, the surroundings are quiet and she is in good health. Be very calm and quiet and do not disturb a mother with very young kittens unless necessary and keep other pets away 

· 强力的干扰、经常被打断或者是疼痛都可能会导致母猫杀死她的后代。如果母猫熟悉周卫环境，周围安静而母猫身体健康，这种风险会降低。请保持镇静和安静，除非必要，否则请勿打扰母猫及幼猫，并使其远离其他宠物。

. if the queen seems to reject one of her kittens, putting some of the birthing fluids on the kitten may help her to accept it 

· 如果母猫似乎拒绝了她的一只小猫，在小猫身上放入一些分娩液可能会帮助她接受它。

. if the queen is not comfortable with her environment and feels she or the kittens are at risk of threat, she may try to move the kittens in her mouth to a preferred location. It is important to ensure the queen has access to a warm, clean and quiet place. She may appreciate a cardboard box lined with soft blankets and sheets to hide the kittens in. 

· 如果母猫对环境感到不适，她或者小猫可能有危险，她可能会尝试将小猫叼到更安全的位置。确保母猫能够找到温暖，干净和安静的地方非常重要。她可能会喜欢里面衬有柔软的毛毯和床单的纸板箱，这样可以隐藏小猫。

. ignoring kittens 

· 对幼猫视而不见

. mastitis – infection of usually one mammary gland, which becomes hot, painful and enlarged. The queen may be off colour 

· 乳腺炎 - 通常感染一个乳腺，变得红肿，疼痛。母猫可能会精神很差

. poor appetite, excessive drinking or vomiting 

· 食欲不振，过度饮水或呕吐

. awkward or clumsy movement, twitching or collapse 

· 尴尬或笨拙的运动，抽搐或摔倒

As with all cats, if any unusual signs are noted, the queen should be checked by your vet. If taking the mother cat to the vet, ask them whether you should also transport the kittens with her. If the kittens are to remain at home during the vet visit, ensure adequate care is arranged for them and that they are kept warm at all times. 

无论猫的品种，如果出现异常，母猫都应该由兽医进行检查。如果你需要把母猫带去兽医那里，那最好是问清楚是否需要携带幼猫同去。如果幼猫无需带到兽医处，则一定要确保它们能够得到足够的照料，随时保暖。

Care of newborn kittens 新生幼猫的护理

Nutrition 营养

The first milk produced – colostrum – is rich in antibodies and will help to protect kittens against diseases. These antibodies last for six weeks or more. Kittens can only absorb colostrum during their first 16 to 24 hours of life and they should feed within two hours of birth. It is essential that they receive this colostrum to protect them against disease. If for any reason a kitten does not receive the first milk, speak to your vet. 

猫的初乳含有丰富的抗体，有助于保护小猫免受疾病侵害。 这些抗体能维持六周或更长时间。 小猫只能在生命的最初16至24小时内吸收初乳，并且应该在出生后两小时内进食。 接受初乳保护对幼猫免受疾病是至关重要的的。 如果出于任何原因，小猫没有吸收初乳，请联系兽医。

Newborn kittens should feed every two to three hours. Kittens receiving adequate nourishment from the queen will sleep in between feeds and do not need additional nutrition until three to four weeks old. If not receiving sufficient food from the queen they may constantly cry and seek the teats. 

初生的幼猫应该每2到3小时被喂一次奶。幼猫从奶水中吸收了足够的营养后就会维持睡眠状态，直到三四周大之前，都无需额外的营养输入。如果它们没能从母猫处得到足够的营养，那就会经常性的啼叫，并且找寻奶头。

Distressed newborn kittens may be restless, without sleeping for prolonged periods, cry excessively, leave the queen and kittening area, appear neglected by the queen or stop feeding and have a reduced sucking reflex. Consult your vet as they will require additional care and supplementary feeding. 

受到惊吓的新生猫咪可能会焦躁、失眠较长时间，也可能歇斯底里的嚎叫，或者是离开母猫以及幼猫区域。有的情况下会被母猫忽略、不再进食、吸吮反应消失。这时就需要联系兽医，为其提供额外的喂养。

If the queen is relaxed, it is recommended to gently weigh kittens at birth, when they are usually between 90 and 110g each. Keep records and weigh the kittens daily to ensure they are gaining around 10-15g each per day, doubling their birth weight by two weeks old. 

如果母猫状态镇静，建议你可以轻柔的对小猫进行称重，理论上每只小猫应该会在90至110克之间。保持每天记录幼猫体重并观察，每天幼猫应当增重10至15克。两周的时候幼猫的体重会是初生体重的二倍。

Weaning – the transition of kittens from the queen’s milk to solid food 
断奶 - 从母乳到固态食物的转变

Weaning can begin at three to four weeks of age but will take several weeks: 
断奶的过程会在三四周时候开始并维持几周的时间：


. start with diluted specialised kitten milk replacement in a shallow bowl. Always follow the product’s instructions very carefully to ensure the correct amount and dilution is used and at the correct temperature. Place a small amount on the mouth and gradually encourage the kitten to lap directly from the bowl. Offer several times a day 
· 从稀释过的猫用奶制品开始，可以将其放置在浅碗中。 请务必仔细按照产品说明进行操作，以确保其温度、数量和稀释度都没有问题。 将少量放在幼猫嘴上，并逐渐鼓励小猫直接从碗中饮用。 每天提供数次供幼猫饮用。

. add a small amount of wet kitten food to the milk over time 
· 随着时间的推移，将少量湿猫粮放在奶中。

. gradually increase the ratio of food to milk until the kitten is eating solid food 
· 逐渐增加猫粮所占比重，最终完全为固态猫粮

. this whole process should happen gradually over three to four weeks while kittens also continue to suckle, until they are feeding freely. Monitor each kitten through this time to ensure they are each feeding effectively 
· 整个过程会持续三至四周，过程中幼猫仍然会哺乳，知道它们能够自如的进食。观察每只幼猫，确保它们都能正常的进食。


Separating the queen from the kittens: 
将母猫和幼猫分隔开来：

. once fully weaned, it is a good idea to allow the queen to gradually spend time apart from the kittens each day to help her milk to gradually dry up. However, the kittens will still be learning from her, so kittens should not be fully separated from the queen until at least eight weeks of age. It may be best not to separate the kittens from the queen all at once as her mammary glands may become engorged. A common reaction is to try to mother something else, such as a cuddly toy. Instead gradually separate them over a period of several days 
· 一旦幼猫断奶完成后，建议将母猫隔离开来，帮助其减少乳汁分泌。无论如何，幼猫还需要和母猫学习，所以在幼猫达到八周龄前，完全隔离母猫和幼猫也是不可取的。最好不要立刻将母猫和幼猫分开，这样母猫的乳腺依然会变得饱满，通常的建议是给母猫替代物，比如一个毛绒玩具，并且在几天的时间内，逐步将幼猫和母猫分开。

. some behavioural issues may be seen when kittens are fully separated from their queen and litter mates too early – for example the retention of juvenile behaviours such as kneading or sucking may be seen in cats separated before eight weeks of age 
· 如果幼猫和母猫过早分开，则可能会出现一些行为问题。比如在八周龄之前分开的幼猫可能会出现踩奶、吸吮等幼年行为。

Veterinary care 兽医护理

. Seek veterinary advice on the best time and safe products to use for flea and worm control in both the queen and the kittens – some may be recommended from as young as two days of age, dependent on the risk to the kittens and any treatment the queen had during pregnancy. Also, discuss the best time to start a vaccination course, to protect the kittens from disease as the protection they received from the queen’s colostrum wanes and leaves them vulnerable to disease – often at eight to nine weeks of age 
· 及时寻求兽医的建议，对母猫以及幼猫使用专用体内体外驱虫药。有人建议幼猫应该在两天大的时候就进行驱虫，不过这应该考虑到幼猫的身体状况以及母猫怀孕期间的状况。同时，你需要和兽医商定合适的时间，为幼猫进行免疫注射。这样能够避免其体内留存的母乳抗体失效后感染疾病。疫苗注射通常会在幼猫八周至九周龄时进行。

. Also seek your vet’s advice on the best time to rehome the kittens – it will depend on their behavioural development, as well as the risk of disease. However, whenever possible, do not separate the kittens from the queen until at least eight weeks of age, except on veterinary advice 
· 同样，你也需要咨询兽医何时给幼猫找新家的问题。这取决于幼猫的行为学习完善程度，以及抵抗力高低是否有患病的风险。无论如何，最好不要在幼猫八周之前将其和母猫分开。当然如果兽医建议，则需要遵循医嘱。

. Neutering – see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Neutering 
· 绝育 - 参阅猫咪保护基础知道之绝育篇


– family planning for felines 猫科的繁衍规划

. The queen can be neutered while she is still with or feeding the kittens as long as the surgical wound will not be affected by enlarged mammary glands. Fortunately the spay wound will normally be on her side. You do not need to wait until her milk has dried up, though it is usually best to wait until the kittens are no longer dependent on her and neuter her when the kittens are around eight weeks of age. The queen can get pregnant again as early as one to two weeks after giving birth, so it is advisable to get her neutered promptly 
· 即便是母猫仍然和幼猫在一起甚至是喂食，你也可以给它进行绝育。前提是肿大的乳腺不会对绝育的伤口造成感染。幸运的是手术伤口通常会在母猫侧面。进行绝育不需要等母猫奶水消失，尽管最好是等到幼猫不在依赖母猫的时候。你可以在幼猫八周大的时候对母猫进行绝育。母猫在生产后一至两周就能再次怀孕。所以建议适时绝育。

. The kittens should be neutered around four months of age. If neutering is not carried out by then, males should be separated from females and the queen – to prevent in-breeding. Ask your vet for help with sexing the kittens, if needed 
· 幼猫应该在四个月大的时候进行绝育。如果没有及时绝育，公猫应该和母猫分割开来，这样能够避免近亲交配。如果需要，你可以咨询兽医关于如何判别小猫的性别。

Behavioural development 行为学习

– see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Understanding your cat’s behaviour. 
- 参见猫咪保护基础指导之理解猫的行为

Kittens learn what is normal and safe during a very sensitive period of development between two and eight weeks of age – the ‘socialisation period.’ Having a variety of positive experiences during this time period – for example with different sights, sounds, textures and smells – will mean they are more likely to be able to adapt in the future. 
幼猫会在两周至三周的非常敏感的阶段（社交化阶段）学习什么是正常以及什么没有威胁。在这个阶段如果能够接收到一系列正向的反馈，比如不同的景色、声音、纹理以及气味，能够很大程度上决定他们未来能够更好的适应。

Kittens which are not exposed to different experiences during this sensitive period are more likely to be fearful of novelty later in life. For example, feral kittens born in the wild without exposure to people during the socialisation period cannot be tamed and will remain very scared of people throughout their lives, making them unsuitable as pets. 
在这个敏感时期没有相关经历的小猫更可能在生命后期对新奇事务感到害怕。 例如，在社会化时期如果野生小猫不能接触人，那长大后就很难被驯服，并且一生中都会非常害怕人，使其不适合作为宠物。

It is therefore important that kittens have positive experiences before seven weeks of age, with as many aspects of the domestic environment they are likely to meet in the future such as: 
所以在幼猫七周大之前最好让其感受到正向的刺激，尤其是将来可能会遇到的刺激，比如:

. the noise of the washing machine, vacuum cleaner etc 
· 洗衣机、吸尘器的噪声等

. car journeys to prepare for veterinary visits 
· 乘坐汽车出行的经历能够让其适应去兽医诊所

. meeting a variety of different people – from babies to adults 
· 认识很多不同的人，包括孩子以及成年人。

. being gently touched and handled 
· 被轻柔的触碰以及抱起


Ensure these are gentle and positive experiences or this can cause more harm than good. 
确保在以上过程中对猫都有轻柔正向的体验，反之则会弊大于利。

Cats which see and smell unrelated and non-aggressive cats when they are under eight weeks of age usually get on better with other cats as adults. Of course, take care to avoid any stress to the queen and maintain good hygiene standards to prevent the transmission of disease – so avoid direct contact.

Making the most of opportunities for socialisation during this sensitive period will help the kittens to be well-adjusted, content and sociable pets for the rest of their lives. Kittens can learn a great deal from their mother, so it is recommended that they stay with her until they are at least eight weeks of age.

Rehoming 

It is important to find suitable new homes for the kittens with owners who will provide for them and have them neutered. Kittens may be homed singly or in pairs, but if homed singly, ensure the new owners will provide sufficient stimulation. If homed in pairs, ensure the new owners will provide separate beds, bowls and toileting areas for the kittens in case they choose to live more separate lives when they are older. For more information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guides: Caring for your kitten and Understanding your cat’s behaviour. 

Supplementary feeding and hand rearing 

In most situations, kittens will have their nutritional needs met by their mother. However, if the queen dies, rejects the kittens or is too ill to support them, assistance will be required. It can be very risky to rear orphaned kittens using another lactating queen. The queen may not accept the kittens, she may neglect or attack them and there is the risk of spreading infectious diseases – some of which may be fatal. Seek veterinary advice and discuss hand rearing. 
Hand reared kittens need: 

. 	a carer who can attend to them throughout the day and night 

. 	a clean, warm environment. If there is no queen, a cat-carrying basket with lots of bedding and a soft toy to snuggle up to is ideal 

. to be provided with a safe source of heat 

. a strict hygiene routine to prevent disease 

. a consistent feeding regime. Newborn kittens must be fed every two to two and half hours 

. to be stimulated to pass urine and faeces before and after each feed until at least three weeks old 

. to be adequately socialised with positive experiences and given the opportunity to be taught normal behaviour that the kittens would normally learn from their queen 


If a queen is only temporarily ill, kittens may only need to be hand fed for a few days, while in other situations kittens may need to be fed by hand until they are weaned. 

If a litter is too large for the queen to support and as long as the kittens are gaining some milk from their mother, they may only need supplementary feeding. If possible, it is important that they remain with their queen and litter mates because orphaned kittens may be at risk of developing behavioural issues. 

If staying with the queen is not possible, then kittens need to be given the opportunity to learn normal behaviour, such as how to deal with frustration – something the kittens would normally learn from their mum. As the kitten starts weaning, slightly delay giving the feed as well as delay providing attention – including eye contact – as opposed to instantly meeting the kitten’s every demand. However, it is equally important to ensure the kitten’s nutritional needs are met. 

It is also essential that kittens are not encouraged to bite or attack hands or fingers and that these behaviours are not reinforced by an excited reaction. 

Hand feeding 

Use substitute kitten milk replacer, formulated specifically for kittens – seek your vet’s advice on an appropriate milk and guidance on hand rearing. Cow or goat’s milk should not be used as kittens cannot easily digest this. Manufacturer’s instructions should be followed carefully regarding dilution, frequency and volume of feeding – overfeeding can be as dangerous as underfeeding. The milk should be warmed to approximately 35°c. Test it carefully by allowing a drop of milk to fall on the inside of your wrist – you will not feel it when it is the right temperature. It is important that the milk is not too hot or too cold. 

Feeding should be done with great care as it is easy for kittens to inhale the milk and develop pneumonia which can be fatal. Specialised feeding bottles and teats can usually be bought from your vet. 

Hypoglycaemia – low blood sugar 

Hypoglycaemia results from inadequate or infrequent feeding. It can cause severe depression, muscle twitching and occasionally lead to convulsions. If a kitten refuses to feed, prompt veterinary care is required. Kittens have no reserves and will deteriorate very rapidly. 

Toileting 

Kittens are unable to pass urine or faeces without assistance for the first few weeks of their lives so the ano-genital region 
– the area around the bottom and the urinary opening of the kitten being hand-reared – needs to be stimulated using a slightly damp piece of cotton wool before and after each feed to encourage toileting. The mother would normally do this by licking the rear end of kittens before, during and after feeding. 

This should be carried out in the litter tray if possible so that the kittens learn to associate the feeling of litter under their feet with going to the toilet. From about four weeks of age, simply placing them in the litter tray should encourage them to pass urine and faeces on their own. Ensure the litter tray has shallow sides so the kittens can access it easily and provide litter with a sandy texture. 

Constipation can be a problem in hand reared kittens. Normal faeces have the consistency of toothpaste. If the faeces become very hard, making the kitten strain excessively or if a kitten does not pass any motions for a day, veterinary advice should be sought. 

Diarrhoea can be caused by overfeeding, by giving too concentrated a solution of milk replacer, or by an infection. Because a kitten’s condition can deteriorate rapidly, it is best to consult your vet if a kitten is suffering from diarrhoea. 

Hygiene precautions 

Hygiene is of the utmost importance as hand reared kittens are very prone to infection. Kittens that have received no colostrum from the queen will have little or no immunity to disease. It is vital that these kittens are protected from exposure to disease, including other cats and their faeces. Some feline infectious diseases can be fatal or lead to lifelong health issues. 

Personal hygiene when preparing feeds and toileting kittens should be excellent and utensils used for preparing or administering the milk should be safely sterilised – seek advice from your vet. 

Temperature considerations 

Kittens cannot regulate their own temperature well. If the mother is not there to keep them warm then: 

. ensure that newborn kittens are towel dried quickly 

. provide a source of warmth such as a covered heat pad or well wrapped hot water bottle. Make sure these are not too hot and that there is somewhere for the kittens to move away to should they overheat 



Normal kitten development 
. Birth weight – approximately 90 to 110g – dependent on breed and number of kittens in the litter 

. Growth rate – kittens should gain around 50 to 100g/week (10-15g/day) and should double their birth weight by two weeks of age 

. The umbilical cord should dry out quickly after the birth and remain dry until it naturally falls off around three days after birth 

. Eyes are closed at birth and open at an average of 10 days old – though this varies from two to 16 days. The iris – or coloured part of the eye – stays a blue-grey colour until four to six weeks old before changing colour permanently 

. Crawling starts at seven to 14 days old 

. Walking starts at around two weeks old 

. Kittens cannot pass urine and faeces without stimulation of the rear end by the queen until around three weeks of age 

. Weaning starts at around three to four weeks old 

. The sensitive period of a kitten’s learning is two to eight weeks of age – the ‘socialisation period’ 

. Kittens can start to spend short periods of time away from the queen from six to seven weeks of age 

. Kittens should not be fully separated from the queen until at least eight weeks of age 

. Vaccination can usually start at eight to nine weeks of age – worm and flea treatment is often recommended before this 

. Sexual maturity is reached from four months of age 

. Kittens lose their 26 baby teeth and have their 30 adult teeth by six months of age 

. Social maturity occurs between 18 months and four years of age, when relationships between cats may change
