Cats living together 群居的猫


If you already have cats that live together, or are thinking of getting two cats or more, there are some important things to consider about their social nature. Taking the steps in this leaflet will help them to live in harmony, without hidden signs of conflict and stress and will hopefully enhance your bond with your cats. 

如果你已经有几只猫生活在一起，或者打算让两只猫或者更多猫在一起生活。那你需要从它们的天性考虑一些问题。按这个手册的建议一步一步来，能够使猫们能够和谐共处，消除可能产生的冲突，让你和你的猫们能够和谐相处。

Cat behaviour can be very subtle and just because cats are not fighting or hissing at each other, it does not necessarily mean that they are friends. It can be helpful to watch them carefully to assess whether they get along and consider where their resources are placed, to ensure your cats are all happily cohabiting. 

猫的行为相当细微，即便在一起没有打架或者是互相嘶吼，也不代表它们就是朋友。你需要小心观察它们是不是合得来，而且需要合理摆放它们的食物等资源，确保它们能够和谐共处。



Understanding the cat’s ancestry 了解猫的祖先

To understand cats, we need to look at the behaviour of their ancestors. Today’s moggy shares common ancestry with the African wildcat – a solitary cat which is still found in North Africa today. It generally chooses to live alone, rather than in a social group with other cats. 

为了能够更好地了解猫，我们需要去了解一下猫的祖先的行为。今天的家猫和非洲野猫是同一个祖先。非洲野猫是在今天仍然能够在北非找到的一种离群索居的猫类。它们更倾向于单独生活而不是群居。

The African wildcat lives in the savannah, hunting rodents which are relatively sparse in numbers, so wildcats are widely dispersed to avoid competition for the small amount of food available. They maintain a territory to ensure other cats are kept away from their patch. 

非洲野猫生活在萨瓦那，以分布稀少的仓鼠为食物，所以必须分散开来避免产生小范围内激烈的竞争。它们会维护自己的领地，阻止其他猫的进入。

Cat behaviour 猫的习性

Domestic cats are similar to the African wildcat in that they still have an inherent desire to be solitary hunters and maintain a territory. However, they can live well together in circumstances when: 

家猫的习性和非洲野猫相仿，都喜欢独自狩猎并且有自己的领地。不过在以下情况下它们也能和谐共处：

. they perceive each other to be in the same social group and there are sufficient resources provided for them to avoid competition 
· 它们接受彼此作为一个社群，而且生存资源充足不存在竞争。

Feral cats have not been socialised with people or the domestic environment. Sometimes feral cats live in groups 
– called colonies – if they perceive each other to be in the same social group and there are sufficient food sources for them. Feral colonies often consist of related females and they recognise each other from a common scent which is shared and reinforced through positive activities, such as rubbing against and grooming each other. They will usually protect the territory from intruder cats which bear a different scent, swiftly sending them packing. 

野猫没有能够和人类以及家庭环境建立社交化的联系。如果有足够的食物，有时候野猫接受彼此会形成群落。野猫群落可能会包含若干有血缘关系的母猫，并且会通过不断地互相蹭以及顺毛来保持共同的气味。它们会保护领地不被外来的、有不同气味的猫侵犯。并且很快赶走入侵者。

Ferals do not depend on each other to source food, so they hunt and eat separately and the same is true for our pet cats.

野猫习惯独立觅食，家猫也是一样。

Cohabiting 共存

While some cats can form very strong social bonds, sometimes cats living in the same household do not perceive each other to be in the same social group, although under stress they will tolerate the presence of others – especially for a particularly valued resource such as food, a fuss from the owner, or the sunniest spot in the house. 

尽管有的猫能够形成比较强的社交关系，不过有时虽然并没有接受彼此组成群落，但它们迫于压力以及相对重要的资源（比如食物、主人的责备或者是屋子里最温暖的角落）会忍受其他猫的存在。

. Some cats will ‘block’ access to food, water or litter trays from other cats that they live with. This is done very subtly so owners often do not notice and it can be very stressful for the affected cat – sometimes even leading to behavioural problems 
· 有的猫会霸占食物、水源或者是猫砂盆，不让其他猫使用。这种行为可能很微妙，主人未必能够观察到，并且对于被欺负的猫可能影响很大， 有时可能会造成行为方面的问题。

. Some cats operate a more tolerant ‘time share’ system where one cat may use a particular area in the morning and the other cat will then use that area in the afternoon, for example
· 有些猫会形成一种更为宽容的“分时间共享”的体系。比如早晨某只猫能使用某个区域，而到了下午其他的猫能够使用这个区域。

. Others may live separately in a particular area of the house. For example, one cat may live upstairs, while the other cat lives downstairs 
· 有时猫可能会占据房子不同的角落。比如，一只猫可能住在楼上，而另一只住在楼下。

. Sometimes other events may precipitate signs of conflict – such as illness in one of the cats in a household. For example, a cat which develops a disease which increases its fluid intake – such as diabetes, or renal disease – may start to urinate on a carpet away from the litter tray. There may not be anything wrong with the cat’s ability to use a litter tray, instead it may be that the tray is blocked at certain times by other cats in the household and the cat is unable to access the tray when it needs to 
· 一些现象可能意味着猫之间存在冲突：比如群猫中的一只猫突然生病了。比如一直患上了会使其增加水分摄入的疾病（比如糖尿病、肾病等）之后，可能会出现在猫砂盆外的毯子上尿尿的情况。这不意味着这只猫不会用猫砂，而很可能是因为猫砂在某些时间段被其他猫占用，导致了这只猫不能在有排尿需要的时候使用上猫砂盆。

Same social group? 同一个社交群落？

Signs of aggression and conflict are not the only way to tell that cats are in different social groups. The signs can be subtle, so you need to look for the positive signs of social interaction. 

猫之间的冲突和打架并不是区分它们是否和谐共存的唯一标准。标准可能相当细微，你需要仔细观察猫之间是否有好的社交迹象。

Cats are in the same social group if they sleep touching each other and spend time rubbing and grooming each other, sharing and reinforcing their common scent. There is nothing more endearing that seeing two cats choosing to cuddle up with one another. 

在同一个的社群的猫会在一起贴着睡觉，并且会花时间互相磨蹭、互相顺毛。这样能够巩固它们共有的气味。这种两只猫互相依偎的场景实在是看起来温馨。

If you have more than two cats, you may find you have more than two social groups – in fact it is quite possible to have six cats and five or six social groups within them. This is more likely to happen if they were introduced as adults, were forced to interact too quickly and given insufficient resources. Even sibling cats may not necessarily remain in the same social group and may drift apart as they approach social maturity, between 18 months and four years of age. 

如果你不只有两只猫，你可能会发现猫之间会形成不止两个群落。事实上如果有6只猫，可能会产生出5到6个群落。这种情况往往出现在猫们是在成年后才互相认识，被强迫共同生活，而且并没有足够的食物等资源的情况下出现的。就算是同辈分的猫都不一定最终会在同一个社交群落，可能会在社交成熟期（18个月大~四岁）逐渐脱离群落。

Resource placement 资源的放置 

Cats in one social group are best provided with separate food, water and litter trays from cats which are in a different social group. Place these in a different part of the home. In fact, it may even be a good idea to feed cats 
in the same social group in different areas to reduce the risk of relationship breakdown. 

社群猫的资源最好是分别放置在家中不同的角落。事实上，在同一群落的猫最好也在不同区域喂食，避免因为竞争造成的关系破裂。

Do you want another cat? 你想要领养领一只猫吗？

If you already have one or more cats, think carefully before getting another cat as it’s an important decision. There are many factors to consider. Can you afford the daily costs, including veterinary care for which big bills can be unexpected? Do you have enough space in your home to provide extra resources in the right locations to support another cat? Do you have enough time for another cat? Has your cat coped with the presence of other cats in the past? See Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Caring for your cat. 

如果你已经有一只或者不止一只猫了，那你需要慎重考虑是否养新的猫。有很多因素都需要考虑，比如你是否能接受日常的花费(包括可能产生的大额医疗费用），比如你的家里是否还有足够的空间来为另一猫提供额外的生存资源？你是否有额外的时间分给新的猫？你现在的猫是否接受过其他猫？具体可以参加猫咪保护基础指导之关爱你的猫票。

Cats are all unique and have different characters. Although a cat might have lived with another cat in the past, this does not mean that they will necessarily tolerate a new cat immediately or even at all. If a cat’s companion cat has recently died, hold off getting a new cat as a ‘friend’, at least until the remaining cat has had time to adjust. In some cases, cats actually seem to blossom once they are on their own and prefer to remain in a single-cat household. This can be difficult for us to understand as humans are a more social species. Thinking from a cat’s perspective takes a different approach. 

每只猫都不一样，有着各异的性格。尽管一只猫可能在过去接受过其他的猫，但这不意味着它能够立刻接受另一只新猫。有可能它永远也会再接受。如果两只共同生活的猫最近死了一只，那么千万不要立刻给剩下的一只找个伴。至少要等这只猫能够有一些时间适应。某些情况下，猫在独处之后会更加自然。作为社交属性更强的人类，我们可能很难理解猫的这种需要。

Cats which have been in contact with unrelated and non-aggressive cats when they were kittens – less than seven weeks of age – sometimes cope better with the presence of other cats when they are adults. 

对于那些在小时候（七周龄前）曾经和陌生的、没有攻击性的猫相处过得的猫来说，长大后可能会更容易接受其他猫。

Introducing cats 让猫互相认识

Unfamiliar cats should be introduced very slowly in the hope that they will ultimately perceive each other to be in the same social group, or at least peacefully cohabit. This can be helped by providing plentiful resources in a variety of different places in the home to avoid conflict and competition. 

对于互相不认识的猫，应该安排非常缓慢的认识过程，这样它们才有可能最后接受彼此，或者差一点，能够和平共处。把充足的食物、水源等摆放在不同的角落能够避免可能出现的冲突和竞争。

If cats are forced together too quickly, it may lead to lifelong conflict and stress which is difficult to resolve – first impressions are all important. Unfortunately, all too often, cats are introduced without sufficient time and resources to successfully integrate. The result can be two cats forced to cohabit under stress. Behavioural problems may result, or they may become withdrawn or intolerant of attention. 

如果猫被强迫很快在一起，可能会导致终生的冲突和压力，很难解决。第一印象很重要。不幸的是，这种因为不充足的见面导致的不融合经常发生。结果往往是两只猫迫于压力在一起生存。行为问题可能因此发生，或者可能会产生内向抗拒、不接受关爱的情形。

The tips on the following pages, together with patience and understanding, will help you ensure that initial introductions start off long and happy relationships. If you succeed, not only will your cats be happy, but you will be rewarded with the frequent delight of watching charming interactions between your cats. 

遵从以下建议加上你的耐心和理解，能帮你的猫们简历长久而快乐的关系。如果你成功让两只猫接纳彼此，不光会给猫带来良好的心态，观察两只猫之间温馨的互动对于你来说也是一种回报。

Important resources for cats 对于猫很重要的物资 

If you have an existing resident cat, ensure that all their routines remain the same where possible. Shut the new cat in the room that the resident cat uses the least. 

如果你的现在已经在养一只猫，那你需要确保在不影响其日常生活的基础上，把新来的猫关进它很少去的房间。

When introducing two cats to each other for the first time, it is best to give each cat a separate room. In each room provide each cat with: 

当你需要把两只猫第一次介绍给彼此的时候，最好是给每只猫一个单独的房间，在每个房间提供以下资源：

. food and water. Cats like to drink away from where they eat, so place the food and water bowls in separate areas sited away from the litter tray 
· 食物和水源。猫不喜欢和别的猫共享水源，所以你需要把食物和水碗放置在远离猫砂盆的不同区域。

. somewhere to hide. It is very important for cats to have somewhere to hide – eg a cardboard box on its side, or under the bed – particularly when adapting to a new environment 
· 有躲藏的场所。对于猫来说很重要就是有地方可以隐藏，这个地方可以是纸箱子或者是床底。在猫需要适应新环境的时候尤其是这样。

. a viewing platform. Cats love to view their surroundings from a height. You could offer access to high spots eg shelves or the top of a wardrobe window sills. Ensure easy access by placing a stool nearby 
· 一个能够环视四周的平台，猫喜欢在高处观察四周，你应该给猫创造条件让其能够到达架子、碗柜顶部等高点。你可以在附近放置猫爬架。

. somewhere to sleep – igloo beds, cardboard box, blankets in elevated places 
· 有睡觉的地方，比如雪屋式的猫窝，或者是高处的篮子。

. toys – be aware that a cat may not want to play while they are settling in 
· 猫玩具，不过猫在适应环境的阶段可能不需要。

. a scratching post – try placing this near to where the cat sleeps as they often like to stretch and scratch after they wake up 
· 猫抓板可以放置在他们睡觉的场所附近，猫通常会在醒来之后磨爪。

. litter tray – placed away from food and water bowls 
· 猫砂盆，需要放置的远离食物和水源。

You can install a facial pheromone diffuser, such as Feliway., in the area that each cat uses to sleep, to make the environment more reassuring for the cats. 
你可以在每只猫睡觉的地方喷洒Feliway等信息素。这样能够给猫营造一个安全舒适的环境。

Before introducing the cats physically, introduce them to each other’s scent. Swap scents by: 
在真正把两只猫放在一起之前，你需要让它们互相接受彼此的气味。你需要：

. stroking each cat with a separate clean, soft cloth and dabbing it around your home and furniture or leaving the cloth in the cat’s environment to sniff when the cat is ready to investigate 
· 用干净的软布摩擦每只猫的下巴，然后把气味涂抹在家中的各个角落。你也可以把这个软布放在某处，任由猫自己探索。

. keep swapping the scents until the cats show no reaction to the smell 
· 你需要保持这个气味交换的过程，直到猫不再对另一只毛的气味有反应。

. if the cats avoid the scent cloth, then the scent swapping stage is going to take longer 
· 如果猫不能够接受沾有另一只猫气味的软布，那这个气味交换的过程就需要持续更长时间。

Keep mixing scents until the cats show no reaction to the smell. You can progress to allowing them to see each other, but not letting them touch or meet one another. Try placing a glass or mesh door between the cats, and allow each cat to approach or hide as they choose. Do not progress to a face-to-face introduction until the cats either ignore each other or show positive feline social behaviour – such as attempting to groom each other or rub heads on each other through the divider. 

在对彼此气味没有任何反应之后，你可以进一步让它们互相能够看见，但是不能够有肢体接触。你可以在两只猫之间放上玻璃门或者是纱门，这样两只猫能够自主选择是躲藏还是进行交互。在两只猫彻底忽视彼此的气味或者是展现出很积极的社交行为（比如试图互相顺毛或者是隔着障碍物互相蹭头）之前，千万不要直接跳到互相见面的阶段。

When it is time to introduce your cats face to face, it helps to: 
在互相见面的环节，以下建议能够有所帮助：

. ensure easy escape routes are available for both cats, as well as easy access to places higher up, such as furniture or shelves 
· 确保两只猫都有安全快速的逃跑路径，到达高处的路径。

. start in a fairly large room where they can stay at a distance from each other 
· 在一个足够大的房间进行，这样两只猫能够保持距离

. supervise the cats when they are together 
· 在两只猫交互的过程中保持关注

. work at a pace that the cats are comfortable with and go back a step if necessary 
· 保持一个猫能够接受的进度，一旦情况不好，则需要回退重来。

. only introduce for short periods of time during feeding time to help form positive associations with each other, before returning the cats to separate rooms 
· 在喂食前进行短暂的见面，这样能够给两只猫形成正向的联系。

. gradually start to fuss or play with the cats for a short time, so their attention is on you, before putting the food down 
· 慢慢的抚摸或者和两只猫玩一小会，这样它们的注意力就在你的身上。之后给它们食物。

If this is tolerated, gradually increase the time they spend together. 
如果以上流程进展的顺利，你可以逐渐加大它们在一起的时间。

It can take anything from a day to many weeks for cats to tolerate each other, so don’t give up if there is some hissing and spitting initially, just go back a step. They are unlikely to fight, but have a blanket ready just in case, so you can separate them. Take care to avoid being bitten or scratched as the cats may be quite excited. Don’t chase or shout at them as this will only lead to them associating each other with bad things. 

让两只猫互相接受彼此，整个过程可能花费一天到很多周之久。所以一旦出现互相嘶吼等现象，你也不应该放弃，而是应该后退一步。即便它们不太可能打架，但是为了以防万一，还是准备一个笼子，这样有情况能够隔离彼此。小心不要被激动的猫抓伤或者是咬伤。不要试图追逐或者是向猫大喊大叫，这样只会给他们之间留下不好的印象。

As the cats become more comfortable in each other’s company, try giving them titbits to encourage them to come closer. Choose somewhere where they can escape easily – placing an object such as a chair between the feeding bowls may help them feel less threatened. Over time, you can move the bowls closer together but do not place them side by side. 

一旦两只猫能够接受彼此的存在，你可以通过给他们食物的方式让它们走的更近。选择一个它们能够逃脱的地方，在两个食碗中间放上一把椅子，这样它们能够更加放松。
Many cats prefer to eat separately to other cats – even those cats in the same social group, as a throwback to their evolutionary past when they would hunt – and eat – separately. Cats can feel vulnerable when they are eating, so place food and water bowls slightly away from the wall, so the cat has space to sit with its back to the wall and is able to survey the room while eating or drinking. 

Remember that if your cats are apart for any reason, for example if one has to stay at a boarding cattery or a vets, this may affect their scent and they may not be recognised as part of the same social group when they return, The longer a cat is away, the harder it can be to reintegrate. It’s a good idea to keep the cats apart – so the absent cat can pick up the smells of home – and slowly reintroduce them. Consider where you place their resources such as food bowls and litter trays, bearing in mind the advice above. 

By taking the simple steps outlined in this leaflet, you can often dramatically improve the quality of life of the cats living in your household. 

If you have problems please seek help sooner rather than later, as it may be easier to resolve a recently developed problem, than one which has occurred for some time. 

If cats have been introduced too quickly, you may need to give them separate rooms and start the integration procedure from scratch. Speak with your vet for further advice who may recommend referral to a suitably qualified behaviourist.
