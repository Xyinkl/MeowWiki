When to let go 什么时候放手


The average life expectancy of a cat is around 14 years but many cats live well beyond this age. As a pet owner, it is important that you are able to assess your cat’s quality of life in order to prevent suffering as they get older, or if they become ill. 

猫的平均寿命约为14岁，尽管有很多猫的寿命远远超过了这一数字。作为主人，衡量你猫的生活质量对于避免其生病或者是晚年受苦很重要。

Monitoring your cat 监控你的猫

You know your cat better than anyone, so you will soon notice any changes in their behaviour or health. You should monitor your cat’s thirst and appetite, their body and coat condition, their behaviour and general demeanour and their toileting habits. If you become aware of any of the following, take your cat to the vet for a check up: 

你比任何人都了解你的猫，所以一旦它的行为或者是健康有变化，你都会发现。你应该监控它的进食饮水、身体被毛状况、行为举止以及如厕习惯。如果你发现如下症状，请带猫去兽医那里做检查：

· 对人以及其他宠物缺乏忍耐，不再对之前喜欢的活动感兴趣——这些都可能是疼痛或者是潜在健康问题的征兆。


Sometimes you may just notice that your cat has changed their routine or is not quite right rather than any of the specific signs above. 

有时，你可能只是发觉猫的一些小变化，不是那么对劲，而不是出现了上述的症状。

Your vet will examine your cat and recommend any further tests or treatments that may be needed. If the vet diagnoses an incurable disease, you will need to carefully consider the quality of your cat’s life. Your vet will advise you whether drugs or treatment are available to extend your cat’s life, but will only recommend this if your pet could still have a good quality of life. 

兽医会给猫做检查并且如果有必要的话进行进一步检查或治疗。如果被查出了不能被治愈的疾病，你可能需要谨慎考量猫的生活品质了。兽医会给出能够延长猫的寿命的药物或者是治疗建议。不过我们只建议在猫还能够正常生活的前提下进行此类治疗。

The bond between owner and cat is very special, so it is understandable that you will want to keep your cat alive, even if their quality of life begins to deteriorate. However, if there comes a time when your cat is in continual pain, discomfort or distress, the most loving and courageous way you can show them how much you care is to end their suffering. 

主人和猫之间的联系相当亲密，所以主人不顾猫的生活质量已经很差依然要求维持其生命的做法不难理解。不过，如果你的猫已经处在长期疼痛、不适的情况下，更体现爱与勇敢的选择则是结束它们的痛苦。

Assessing quality of life 生活质量评估

Illnesses are not the only form of suffering. You may also need to make an assessment of your cat’s quality of life if they:
不适并不完全体现在疾病上。在以下情况你可能需要对猫的生活质量做个评估：

. can no longer eat or drink normally 
· 不能正常进食、饮水

. are is unable to stand or move normally 
· 不能正常站立或移动

. have difficulty breathing properly

· 可能引发不可控制的疼痛


To choose to have your pet euthanased is one of the most difficult decisions you will ever have to make as a pet owner. The guidance from your vet will be invaluable in making hard choices, but when there is no reasonable alternative, to allow your cat to die in peace and dignity is the kindest decision. 

对于主人来说，为宠物选择安乐死是最为困难的选择之一。来自兽医的建议至关重要，不过一旦别无他法，让其平静安详的离去就是最饱含善意的决定。

What is euthanasia? 什么是安乐死？

Literally meaning ‘good death’, euthanasia is also referred to by vets as humane destruction. You may also hear of pets being ‘put down’ or ‘put to sleep’. 

字面上意味着“善终”，安乐死同样被兽医叫做“人道死亡”。你或许听说过宠物被“放倒”、被“睡觉”。

How is euthanasia carried out? 安乐死是怎么操作的？

安乐死实施前，你需要先签署一份同意书。兽医会在猫的前腿剃毛，在静脉中插入针管，之后注入致命剂量的药物使猫失去意识。  如果猫害怕或者过于暴躁，可能会先被注入镇定来使其安定。某些病重或者是老龄猫的静脉可能会萎缩，可能会很难找，所以可能会在其他部位注射。

Your cat will be asleep in a very short time and their breathing and heartbeat will stop a few seconds later. As your cat loses consciousness, they may take a deep breath, or gasp and occasionally there may be a brief involuntary twitching or spasm of muscles after death has occurred. This is quite normal and should not be mistaken for ‘signs of life’. As the body relaxes, your cat’s bowels or bladder may empty. Their eyes will not close. 

注射后你的猫就会很快睡着并且在几秒后停止呼吸和心跳。由于已经失去意识，它可能会深呼吸或喘气，有时可能会在发生死亡后出现短暂的不自主抽搐或肌肉痉挛。 这很正常，不应该被误认为是'活着的迹象'。 随着身体放松，你的猫的肠或膀胱可能会排空。 他们的眼睛不会自主关闭。

Your vet will check for a pulse or eyelid reflex and may place your cat into a sleeping position. Don’t be alarmed if your cat’s lips are pulled back into a grimace, this is not a sign of pain, but is due to a relaxation of muscles. 

兽医会检查脉搏或眼睑反射，并且可能把你猫摆成睡眠的姿势。 如果你的猫的嘴唇向后抽搐，不要惊慌，这不是痛苦的迹象，只是肌肉放松导致的。

Discuss in advance with your vet whether you wish to be with your cat when they are put to sleep. It may be less stressful for your cat if they can hear a familiar voice and knowing that your cat suffered no pain may comfort you. However, if you are frightened or anxious your cat may sense this and may become upset. You must choose what is right for you. 

你可以提前和兽医沟通自己是不是在现场陪同。如果有熟悉的声音陪同，猫可能会感觉不那么紧张。同样，见证整个无痛的过程对主人也是个安慰。然而，如果你对这些感到恐惧和焦虑那最好不要在场。你需要做出适合自己的选择。



After euthanasia 安乐死后

Decide in advance whether you would prefer your cat to be buried or cremated. 

提前决定好是埋葬猫还是火化猫的遗体。

Cremation 火化

Your vet can arrange for your cat to be cremated, or you can take their body to the pet crematorium yourself. Your cat can be cremated with others and their ashes scattered in the garden of rest, or you can opt for individual cremation after which their ashes can be returned to you. You must inform your vet of your wishes at the time of euthanasia if you want your vet to arrange the cremation. 

兽医可以安排你的猫的火化事宜，或者你也可以自行带去宠物火化馆。火化可以是和其他猫一起，之后骨灰会被撒在陵园。也可以是单独火化，之后骨灰会被还给你。如果要兽医安排火化，那你必须在安乐死时候知会兽医你的选择。

If your cat dies unexpectedly at home and you do not wish to bury them in your garden, contact your vet who can arrange cremation. 

如果你的猫在家时意外死亡，而且你不想把它埋在花园里，联系你的兽医安排火化。

Burial 埋葬

Your cat can be buried in a pet cemetery. Most ceremonies can be accompanied by a short memorial service. If you would prefer to bury your cat in your garden, check with your local authority that this is allowed and make sure that the body is buried at least three feet below the surface. Place a heavy object on top until the ground settles to deter scavengers. 

你的猫可以埋在宠物墓地里。 大多数仪式服务都提供短暂的追悼会。 如果您希望将猫咪埋入您的花园，请与当地的权威部门联系，确保法规允许。并确保遗体至少埋在地表以下三英尺处。 在上面放置一个重物，直到地面沉降以阻止食腐动物的侵袭。

If you wish, you can arrange to donate your cat’s body to a nearby veterinary school for medical research. 

如果你同意，也可以安排把猫的遗体捐献给临近的兽医学校做医学研究。


Coping with pet bereavement 宠物死去后的情绪管理

Losing your much-loved pet can be a very traumatic experience. Don’t be afraid to show your feelings in front of the vet, they will understand. You will need time to grieve and you may go through a mixture of emotions – sadness, loneliness and even anger. This is all quite normal and part of the process of coming to terms with your loss. You should not feel guilty or blame yourself for your cat’s death – the decision for euthanasia is only ever reached as an act of kindness to avoid suffering. Treasure your memories – remember the good times and the joy that your cat brought you. 

失去你最爱的宠物会是非常痛苦的。不要害怕在兽医前流露痛苦，他们会理解的。你需要一段时间伤悲，而且可能经历多种情绪混存的阶段（伤感、孤独甚至是生气）。这一切都是非常正常的事情，也会让你慢慢接受损失。 你不应该为猫的死而感到内疚或责备自己 - 安乐死的决定只是为了减少猫痛苦的一种善意的手段。 珍藏你的回忆 - 记住你的猫带给你美好的时光和快乐。

Losing a pet is often the first time that a child becomes aware of death. It is usually best to be honest with a child and explain the truth as clearly as you can. Be careful when using the term ‘put to sleep’ as a child may expect their pet to wake up again later. Children may want time to say goodbye to their pet and seeing the body may help them understand what has happened. Marking the occasion with some kind of memorial such as a burial can be very therapeutic. 

失去一只宠物通常是孩子第一次经历死亡。如实并且清楚地向孩子解释一切是最好的办法。小心使用“让猫睡觉”的词语，因为孩子可能期待猫还会醒来。可以给孩子和猫说再见的时间，见到猫的遗体也能帮孩子理解什么是死亡。埋葬等仪式会是很好的慰藉。

It can be helpful to talk to someone who understands your feelings. Many GPs and religious ministers recognise the negative effects of suppressing grief and now offer pet bereavement counselling. Pet bereavement helplines are also available. 

和其他理解你的人交流会很有帮助。许多全科医生认识到抑制悲伤的负面影响，现在提供丧失宠物的心理咨询。 丧失宠物之后的求助热线也可以考虑。

Getting another cat 养另一只猫

The decision to get another cat is entirely personal. You may find you want another one almost immediately or that you need time to come to terms with your loss. If your cat has had an infectious illness, your vet may advise you to wait before getting another to reduce the risk of infection remaining in your home. 

决定是否养另一只猫是很个人的选择。你可能会发觉自己立刻就需要另一只猫，也可能还需要一段时间接受这个事实。如果你的猫之前有过传染性疾病，兽医可能会建议你等一等再养另一只。这样能够减少新猫你家中被传染的风险。

Try to remember that cats, like humans, are all individuals. Although your relationship with any new cat will be just as rewarding, they will not be the same as your previous cat and this may take some time to get used to. 

你需要记住的是，猫像人一样，是完全独立的个体。尽管新猫的到来会让你很欣慰，不过它毕竟不会和之前的猫完全一样，你需要时间慢慢适应。
