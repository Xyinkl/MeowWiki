Many owners view ageing as a ‘normal’ process and feel that nothing will help their cat, and some owners worry about mentioning problems they’ve noticed in their older cat as they fear the vet will say it’s serious or that the cat may need to be euthanased. However, these concerns are often unfounded and your vet is there to help wherever they can. Talk to your vet to discuss any concerns you may have. It is very important to take your older cat to see the vet regularly to ensure they are not suffering or in hidden pain – there are lots of treatments available for many of the issues. You’ll want them to enjoy their golden years free from discomfort. 

很多主人把年龄的增长当做是正常的事情，对此感到无计可施。有的主人避免提及老年猫上出现的问题，唯恐兽医会说这很严重需要安乐死。无论如何，这些想法都是不成立的，你的兽医永远能够给你提供可能的帮助。如果你有任何担忧，都请和兽医讨论。定期带老年猫去兽医处体检确保它没有遭受病痛很重要。现在对于各种疾病已经有很多可行的治疗方案。你也希望猫能在安度晚年，不被病痛折磨。

Preventative healthcare 预防性质的健康护理

Elderly cats usually need to be taken to the vet for a health check more often than younger, healthier cats, particularly if they have any age-associated symptoms or diseases. Your vet can advise you on how frequently they need to be seen and many surgeries now run special ‘geriatric’ clinics. Regular weight checks are also important, as are keeping up regular booster vaccinations because cats’ immune systems can weaken with age. 

和年轻的猫、健康的猫相比，老年猫通常需要更频繁的带给兽医进行体检，尤其是当它们有和年龄相关的症状或疾病的时候。你的兽医能够告诉你进行体检的频率。很多老年猫诊所也能够施行很多猫科手术。经常的称量体重很重要，同样重要的还有经常进行增强免疫，以应对老年猫弱化的免疫系统。

Feeding requirements 膳食需求

There is a variety of senior diets available to provide balanced nutrition aimed specifically for older cats. Always ensure that fresh water is always on offer in several different locations throughout the home, including upstairs and downstairs. Provide smaller meals little and often. Monitor your cat’s appetite closely as this can decrease or increase, depending on a variety of health factors. If your cat’s sense of smell reduces, this can lead to a decrease in appetite – you can try warming the food, which will increase the smell and encourage feeding. 

对于老年猫，现在已经有很多成熟的食谱来为其提供均衡、有目的性的营养供应。一定要保证家里不同位置、楼上楼下几个点位总有充足的新鲜饮用水供应。可以少食多餐。严密监控你的猫的胃口变化情况，这可能是很多健康因素的表征。如果你的猫味觉变弱，可能会导致食欲减退，你可以试着加热食物，这样会让气味更加浓郁，促进食欲。

Surgery considerations 进行手术的考虑

Any surgery on an elderly cat should be considered carefully as there may be an increased risk of other health problems. Your vet will carry out a thorough pre-operative assessment to check your cat’s internal health. They can advise you on any specific, individual concerns and may suggest diagnostic tests to be run first. 

对于老年猫的手术应该被谨慎对待，因为造成其他健康问题的风险会增大。你的兽医会进行一个全面的术前评估，来检查你的猫的健康状况。他们会给你相关建议，并且可能会要求进行诊断性质的检测。

Grooming 梳理毛发

Older cats experiencing stiffness may find it more difficult to wash and groom so may have a poorer coat condition. You may need to help by grooming your cat gently with a soft brush. Check their claws regularly as they may have difficulty scratching to keep their claws in shape. As cats get older, their claws can become thicker and longer. Be careful that their claws don’t curl round into their pads. Staff at your veterinary surgery can advise you how to look after their coat and claws. Be aware that cats may be sensitive to being touched or groomed in certain areas if they have pain or discomfort. 

老年猫由于身体柔韧性变差，可能会较难梳理自己的毛发，这样被毛就会变得比较糟糕。你可能需要用软的刷子来帮它梳毛。定期检查它的爪子，因为它可能会在磨爪子的时候感到力不从心。猫在变老之后，爪子会变厚变长。一定要小心观察它们的爪子时候弯曲进了肉垫。附近兽医诊所的员工能够告诉你如何关爱它的被毛和爪子。如果猫的某些区域会引发疼痛或者不适，那在被人触碰这些区域的时候可能会表现出相当的敏感。

The following indicates some health issues to watch out for, that elderly cats can be predisposed to: 
以下是你可能需要关注的、老年猫易患的健康问题：

Senility and cognitive dysfunction 
衰老以及认知障碍

Cognitive dysfunction is a decline in higher brain functions, including memory and learning that often occurs with old age. Signs include: 
认知障碍是大脑功能、包括记忆以及认知的减退，经常发生在老年期。症状包括：

. disorientation 
· 失去方向

If you have noticed any changes in your cat’s behaviour, take them to your vets for a health check, discussing the behaviour changes with your vet in as much detail as you can. 

如果你在你的猫身上注意到任何改变，请带猫去做一个体检， 并向兽医尽可能详细的描述你观察的行为变化。

Constipation 便秘

Cats can experience changes in bowel habits as they grow older, including constipation. Signs of constipation include decreased frequency of passing faeces, straining to pass, pain and/or crying when trying to and passing hard faeces. You must ensure your cat always has access to fresh water – speak to your vet for dietary and treatment advice. 



Deafness 

Deaf cats compensate for their lack of hearing by using their other senses, so deafness in cats often goes unnoticed. Signs of deafness may include: 

. no response when called or to loud sounds 

. being easily startled 

. loud miaowing 

. signs of dizziness or disorientation 

Signs of ear disease which may cause deafness include: 

. shaking the head 

. clawing at the ear 

. pus, discharge or an unpleasant odour from the ear 


For more information on how to help your deaf cat, see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Cats with disabilities. 

Dental disease 

Older cats need regular dental health checks to check for signs of dental disease, including tartar build up and red, inflamed gums. Speak to your vet about health checks and preventative care for your cat’s teeth. For more information on diagnosis and treatment, see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Teeth and oral health. 

Diabetes mellitus 

This condition affects the control of blood sugar levels and usually occurs in middle-aged and older cats, particularly those that are overweight. The signs of diabetes can be similar to a number of other diseases and include: 

. increased thirst and/or appetite 

. passing more urine 

. weight loss 

. lethargy/weakness 

. vomiting 

. being more prone to other infections eg skin or urinary tract infections 


Diabetes is often treated more successfully if detected and treated in the early stages. For more information see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Diabetes. 

Hyperthyroidism 

The thyroid is made up of two glands located on either side of the windpipe at the base of your cat’s neck. It helps to regulate metabolic rate. In some cats, the thyroid becomes overactive which speeds up the metabolism. Hyperthyroidism mainly affects cats over the age of 10 and can occur in either or both of the glands. The signs may vary from cat to cat, but most commonly include: 

. increased appetite and/or thirst 

. weight loss 

. behavioural changes such as hyperactivity, restlessness and being more vocal 

. vomiting 

. diarrhoea 

. poor coat condition 


If you notice any of these symptoms, take your cat to see your vet for a health check. Once a cat is treated for hyperthyroidism, they will return to normal fairly quickly in most cases. If the disease has been detected and treated early on the cat often lives several more years. Untreated, it can damage other organs. For more information on diagnosis and treatment see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Hyperthyroidism. 

Kidney disease 

Disease of the kidneys is one of the most common problems affecting middle-aged and older cats. Unfortunately, damage to the kidneys is irreversible and tends to worsen over a period of time. However, with the help of various treatments, affected cats can often maintain a good quality of life for several months or years. Most cats do not show signs of chronic kidney disease until 75 per cent of the kidneys have been damaged. Signs can vary between individuals but the most common signs are: 

. increased thirst 

. passing more urine 

. poor appetite 

. weight loss 

. poor coat condition 

. vomiting 

. lethargy 

. depression 

. bad breath 


Many vets will try to diagnose kidney disease in its early stages, before clinical signs develop, by offering cat owners the option of urine and blood tests for their older cats at routine check-ups or vaccinations. By doing this, early dietary management or other treatment may significantly extend an affected cat’s life expectancy and quality of life. For more information on diagnosis and treatment see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Kidney or renal disease. 

Cancer 

Cats can develop different types of tumours which may either be benign – not usually harmful – or malignant – faster growing and usually harmful. Sometimes the tumours can spread to other areas of the body. It is a good idea to regularly feel all over your cat’s body for any lumps or bumps. Other signs of cancer vary dependent on the organ affected, but can include weight loss, increased thirst, passing more urine, depression, poor coat condition, vomiting and/or diarrhoea. 

Arthritis 

The term ‘arthritis’ means inflammation of the joint and this condition is extremely common in cats. However, it often goes unnoticed as owners think the cat is just slowing down with age, when it is actually a very painful condition. It is worth getting your cat checked regularly as treating chronic problems like arthritis will make a huge difference to their quality of life. The main signs shown in cats are: 

. a change in behaviour, for example: 

. grumpiness, reduced interaction or tolerance with people – the discomfort associated with arthritis can be a cause of aggression in cats 

. not using the litter tray if the sides of the tray are too high for your cat to easily get into 

. reduced interest in play 

. difficulty grooming, especially the middle of the back and tail 

. increased stiffness immediately after resting which gets better with movement 

. stiffness, lameness and reduced mobility – an unwillingness to jump or climb 

If your cat is overweight, this can make arthritis worse so it is very important to ensure they maintain an ideal weight. Regular, moderate exercise will also help – play is the best way to achieve this. 

Arthritis is an ongoing problem and cannot be cured. However, in many cases it can be managed successfully allowing your cat to be mobile, pain-free and to lead a reasonably active life. For more information see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Arthritis. 

Hypertension 

In cats, high blood pressure – known as hypertension – often occurs in association with another underlying disease – for example, cats suffering from kidney disease or hyperthyroidism often have some degree of hypertension as well. It can also occur as a primary problem in itself. The organs most vulnerable to the effects of high blood pressure are the eyes, kidneys, heart and brain. Initially there may be very few signs of high blood pressure, particularly if it is the primary problem but sometimes the signs can occur very suddenly. Signs of hypertension include: 

. blindness 

. changes inside the eye, including bleeding 

. disorientation 

. seizures 


Many cats can go on to lead relatively normal lives following diagnosis and stabilisation of hypertension, but this will depend on the type and severity of any underlying disease. If left untreated, these signs can become permanent so seek veterinary advice as soon as possible. For more information see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Hypertension. 


Cat-friendly homes for the elderly feline 

There are a number of small changes that can be made to your home which will have a big impact on the quality of your cat’s life. While a number of older cats appear to be ‘as young as they feel’ with many still showing kitten-like behaviours, others can benefit from a few home tweaks that ensure that all their resources are within easy reach. 

What you can do to help an older cat 

Microchip 

Make sure your cat is microchipped in case they become disorientated or goes missing. A microchip carries a unique number linked to a database holding your contact details, allowing you to be quickly traced should they stray and be scanned. See Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Microchipping for more information. 

Beds 

Allow your cat to reach favourite places to rest by strategically placing boxes or items of furniture for them to climb. Make sure they have a variety of cosy, well-padded beds in safe warm places that can be readily accessed. Your cat may enjoy the hammock-style radiator beds as they are very warm. 

Somewhere to perch up high 

Older cats can find it difficult to make accurate calculations when jumping and are not as agile as they used to be, especially if they are stiff, in pain or have arthritis. Provide easy ways for cats to access their favourite areas, such as using a ramp or small foot stool to give them access to high surfaces. Make sure it is wide enough and you could also cover it in carpet to give extra grip. It is a good idea to fashion some sort of crash mat underneath the ramp, in case the cat falls. Cushions under windowsills act as crash mats for uncoordinated or wobbly cats. 

Litter trays and toileting 

Provide several litter trays in the house at all times, even if your cat has toileted outside all of their life. There are many occasions when an older cat will need an indoor litter tray, such as when it’s raining outside, if the normal toileting site has frozen over and is hard to dig, or if they feel intimidated by other neighbouring cats. Place the litter trays in quiet, safe areas of the home. 

Providing a large tray gives the cat plenty of space to move around inside. Make sure the tray has a low side so they can get in and out more easily. Some litter types that were acceptable as an adult may be too coarse for older cats. Don’t make any sudden changes, but provide additional trays with 3cm of soft, fine litter that they will find more comfortable under their paws. 

Older cats are less able to defend themselves or a territory and as a result may become more anxious or dependant on their owners. Some cats will feel reassurance from owners that accompany them outside so they are protected against the neighbouring cats. 

If your cat still prefers to toilet outside, provide a newly dug over border as close to the house as possible and maintain it regularly. 

Water and food bowls 

Place water and food bowls in a variety of easily accessible locations around the house, both upstairs and downstairs so they are easy to find and they don’t have to walk up and down stairs just to get food and water. Speak to your vet about the most appropriate diet for your older cat. 

Playtime 

Older cats still like to play, but they need more gentle, brief games than when they were younger. Use toys that are unlikely to intimidate them, such as a feather attached to string that is slowly moved past them. Experiment with different toys to see what captures your cat’s attention. Even if they only watch or slowly swipes the toy with a paw, it is still important beneficial mental stimulation. 

Regular grooming 

As older cats may struggle to look after their coats, additional help and gentle grooming will help to keep your cat’s skin healthy and gives you some valuable bonding time with your cat. Stroking a cat is a great de-stressor and may lower an owner’s blood pressure. 

Scratching posts 

Cats may still want to scratch but can find it difficult as they age. You could provide a horizontal scratching post or one with a lower gradient and softer material such as carpet, which they may find easier. Remember to check their claws regularly. 

Routines 

Cats are creatures of habit and this characteristic becomes more pronounced as they age. They prefer a familiar, regular routine to provide predictability. Where possible, avoid moving furniture so that your cat’s environment is familiar and they can easily find their way around your home. 

Veterinary care 

Seek veterinary advice early if you are worried. Remember, many of the disorders that affect older cats can be treated and managed to allow your cat a happy and content life, particularly when treatment is sought early. However, inevitably there may come a time when your cat is in continual pain, discomfort or distress, and the most loving and courageous way you can show them how much you care is to end their suffering. See Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: When to let go for further information. 

Your elderly cat and you 

Caring for an older cat in their twilight years brings a tremendous joy and many owners actively decide to adopt an older cat because of the endearing qualities they can offer. With their wandering days behind them, older cats tend to stay closer to home and appreciate gentle affection. Owners often comment on the special relationship they have with their older pet, enhanced by some simple measures and an understanding of their needs.
