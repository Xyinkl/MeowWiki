Elderly cats 老年猫            


Not yet over the hill, 
but often overlooked 

衰老过程中，容易被忽略的事项

As your cat enters their golden years, they’ll need some extra understanding for their changing lifestyle. Cats are generally considered geriatric from around 12 years of age and there are lots of simple steps you can take to ensure the later years of your cat’s life are comfortable and happy. You will be rewarded with a content pet, who is often happy to spend much time quietly at home as a wonderful companion. 

由于你的猫在进入晚年，它们新的生活方式可能会需要你额外的关注。猫在12岁左右通常被认为开始衰老，你可以采取很多简单的措施来保证它们的后半生能够舒适愉快。你能够收获一只喜欢花费大量时间安安静静待在家里给你陪伴的宠物。

What happens during ageing? 
猫衰老的过程中会发生什么？

. Activity levels decrease and muscle tone reduces 
· 活动量减少，肌肉萎缩

. Appetite and/or fluid intake may change 
· 食欲以及饮水摄入可能会发生变化

. Vision and/or hearing may not be as acute 
· 视觉和听力可能不会像之前灵敏

. Bowel and urinary system functions may change 
· 消化和泌尿系统功能可能有变化

. The immune system may weaken 
· 免疫系统可能会弱化

. Light sleep may increase but deep sleep decreases 
· 浅睡眠增多，深度睡眠减少

. Coat condition may deteriorate 
· 被毛情况可能变差

. Age-associated disorders may develop, such as arthritis, diabetes, hyperthyroidism or renal impairment 
· 和年龄有关的疾病可能会产生，比如关节炎、糖尿病、甲亢或者是肾衰竭。

. Psychological and behavioural changes can occur, such as senility, aggression, increased dependence or excessive vocalisation 
· 心理、行为上的变化可能会包括衰老、进攻性、更依赖人或者是更话痨。

Many owners view ageing as a ‘normal’ process and feel that nothing will help their cat, and some owners worry about mentioning problems they’ve noticed in their older cat as they fear the vet will say it’s serious or that the cat may need to be euthanased. However, these concerns are often unfounded and your vet is there to help wherever they can. Talk to your vet to discuss any concerns you may have. It is very important to take your older cat to see the vet regularly to ensure they are not suffering or in hidden pain – there are lots of treatments available for many of the issues. You’ll want them to enjoy their golden years free from discomfort. 

很多主人把年龄的增长当做是正常的事情，对此感到无计可施。有的主人避免提及老年猫上出现的问题，唯恐兽医会说这很严重需要安乐死。无论如何，这些想法都是不成立的，你的兽医永远能够给你提供可能的帮助。如果你有任何担忧，都请和兽医讨论。定期带老年猫去兽医处体检确保它没有遭受病痛很重要。现在对于各种疾病已经有很多可行的治疗方案。你也希望猫能在安度晚年，不被病痛折磨。

Preventative healthcare 预防性质的健康护理

Elderly cats usually need to be taken to the vet for a health check more often than younger, healthier cats, particularly if they have any age-associated symptoms or diseases. Your vet can advise you on how frequently they need to be seen and many surgeries now run special ‘geriatric’ clinics. Regular weight checks are also important, as are keeping up regular booster vaccinations because cats’ immune systems can weaken with age. 

和年轻的猫、健康的猫相比，老年猫通常需要更频繁的带给兽医进行体检，尤其是当它们有和年龄相关的症状或疾病的时候。你的兽医能够告诉你进行体检的频率。很多老年猫诊所也能够施行很多猫科手术。经常的称量体重很重要，同样重要的还有经常进行增强免疫，以应对老年猫弱化的免疫系统。

Feeding requirements 膳食需求

There is a variety of senior diets available to provide balanced nutrition aimed specifically for older cats. Always ensure that fresh water is always on offer in several different locations throughout the home, including upstairs and downstairs. Provide smaller meals little and often. Monitor your cat’s appetite closely as this can decrease or increase, depending on a variety of health factors. If your cat’s sense of smell reduces, this can lead to a decrease in appetite – you can try warming the food, which will increase the smell and encourage feeding. 

对于老年猫，现在已经有很多成熟的食谱来为其提供均衡、有目的性的营养供应。一定要保证家里不同位置、楼上楼下几个点位总有充足的新鲜饮用水供应。可以少食多餐。严密监控你的猫的胃口变化情况，这可能是很多健康因素的表征。如果你的猫味觉变弱，可能会导致食欲减退，你可以试着加热食物，这样会让气味更加浓郁，促进食欲。

Surgery considerations 进行手术的考虑

Any surgery on an elderly cat should be considered carefully as there may be an increased risk of other health problems. Your vet will carry out a thorough pre-operative assessment to check your cat’s internal health. They can advise you on any specific, individual concerns and may suggest diagnostic tests to be run first. 

对于老年猫的手术应该被谨慎对待，因为造成其他健康问题的风险会增大。你的兽医会进行一个全面的术前评估，来检查你的猫的健康状况。他们会给你相关建议，并且可能会要求进行诊断性质的检测。

Grooming 梳理毛发

Older cats experiencing stiffness may find it more difficult to wash and groom so may have a poorer coat condition. You may need to help by grooming your cat gently with a soft brush. Check their claws regularly as they may have difficulty scratching to keep their claws in shape. As cats get older, their claws can become thicker and longer. Be careful that their claws don’t curl round into their pads. Staff at your veterinary surgery can advise you how to look after their coat and claws. Be aware that cats may be sensitive to being touched or groomed in certain areas if they have pain or discomfort. 

老年猫由于身体柔韧性变差，可能会较难梳理自己的毛发，这样被毛就会变得比较糟糕。你可能需要用软的刷子来帮它梳毛。定期检查它的爪子，因为它可能会在磨爪子的时候感到力不从心。猫在变老之后，爪子会变厚变长。一定要小心观察它们的爪子时候弯曲进了肉垫。附近兽医诊所的员工能够告诉你如何关爱它的被毛和爪子。如果猫的某些区域会引发疼痛或者不适，那在被人触碰这些区域的时候可能会表现出相当的敏感。

When to take your cat to the vet 什么时候带猫去找兽医

In addition to your regular pet health checks, your cat should be seen by a vet if there are changes to their:

在定期的体检之外，如果在以下部分发生大的改变，那你应该带猫去看兽医：

如果你在你的猫身上注意到任何改变，请带猫去做一个体检， 并向兽医尽可能详细的描述你观察的行为变化。

Constipation 便秘

Cats can experience changes in bowel habits as they grow older, including constipation. Signs of constipation include decreased frequency of passing faeces, straining to pass, pain and/or crying when trying to and passing hard faeces. You must ensure your cat always has access to fresh water – speak to your vet for dietary and treatment advice. 


Deafness  耳聋

Deaf cats compensate for their lack of hearing by using their other senses, so deafness in cats often goes unnoticed. Signs of deafness may include: 

耳聋的猫会用其他的感官来弥补其4听力的不足，所以猫的听力丧失往往不被人注意。耳聋的症状可能包括：

. no response when called or to loud sounds 
· 被呼唤或者周围有较强声音时没有反应

. being easily startled 
· 容易受惊

. loud miaowing 
· 叫声很吵

. signs of dizziness or disorientation 
· 出现不舒服的症状

Signs of ear disease which may cause deafness include: 
能够造成耳聋的耳科疾病包括：

. shaking the head 
· 摇头晃脑

. clawing at the ear 
· 用爪子抓挠耳朵

. pus, discharge or an unpleasant odour from the ear 
· 耳部分泌难闻的分泌物、脓液

For more information on how to help your deaf cat, see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Cats with disabilities. 
需要更多关于如何帮助耳聋猫的信息，请参阅猫咪保护医学指导之残疾猫篇。

Dental disease 牙科疾病

Older cats need regular dental health checks to check for signs of dental disease, including tartar build up and red, inflamed gums. Speak to your vet about health checks and preventative care for your cat’s teeth. For more information on diagnosis and treatment, see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Teeth and oral health. 

老年猫需要定期进行牙科检查，确保没有出现牙科疾病的症状。这些症状包括牙结石形成以及牙龈充血肿胀。和你的兽医沟通，对猫进行体检并且进行预防性的处置。需要更多关于牙科疾病诊断和治疗的信息请参见猫咪保护医学指导之牙齿口腔健康篇。

Diabetes mellitus 糖尿病

This condition affects the control of blood sugar levels and usually occurs in middle-aged and older cats, particularly those that are overweight. The signs of diabetes can be similar to a number of other diseases and include: 

这种病症通常影响对血糖水平的控制，常见于中年及老年猫，尤其常见于超重的猫。糖尿病的症状和很多其他疾病的症状相似：

. increased thirst and/or appetite 
· 食欲或者引水量增加

. passing more urine 
· 排尿增加

. weight loss 
· 体重下降

. lethargy/weakness 
· 身体虚弱

. vomiting 
· 呕吐

. being more prone to other infections eg skin or urinary tract infections 
· 更容易遭受其它感染，比如皮肤感染或者是尿路感染

Diabetes is often treated more successfully if detected and treated in the early stages. For more information see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Diabetes. 

如果发现和处置都比较早期，那么糖尿病是可以被很成功的治疗的。需要更多信息，参见猫咪保护医学指导之糖尿病篇。

Hyperthyroidism 甲状腺亢奋

The thyroid is made up of two glands located on either side of the windpipe at the base of your cat’s neck. It helps to regulate metabolic rate. In some cats, the thyroid becomes overactive which speeds up the metabolism. Hyperthyroidism mainly affects cats over the age of 10 and can occur in either or both of the glands. The signs may vary from cat to cat, but most commonly include: 

  甲状腺由位于猫脖子气管两侧的两个腺体构成。有调节新陈代谢率的作用。有些猫的甲状腺会发生过于活跃的情况，这会加速新陈代谢。甲亢主要发生于十岁以上的猫，在两侧都可发生。具体的症状因猫而异，但是主要是以下症状：
 
. increased appetite and/or thirst 

· 食欲增加、饮水增加

. weight loss 

· 体重降低

. behavioural changes such as hyperactivity, restlessness and being more vocal 

· 亢奋、焦躁、话多等行为改变。

. vomiting 

· 呕吐

. diarrhoea 

· 拉稀

. poor coat condition 

· 被毛状态差

If you notice any of these symptoms, take your cat to see your vet for a health check. Once a cat is treated for hyperthyroidism, they will return to normal fairly quickly in most cases. If the disease has been detected and treated early on the cat often lives several more years. Untreated, it can damage other organs. For more information on diagnosis and treatment see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Hyperthyroidism. 

 如果你注意到了以上任何症状，请带猫去兽医处做个体检。一旦猫被确诊为甲亢并加以治疗，往往能够很快恢复正常，能够继续存活几年时间。如果不加以治疗，则可能危害其他器官。需要更多关于甲亢的诊断和治疗信息，请参阅猫咪保护医学指导之甲亢篇。

Kidney disease 肾脏疾病

Disease of the kidneys is one of the most common problems affecting middle-aged and older cats. Unfortunately, damage to the kidneys is irreversible and tends to worsen over a period of time. However, with the help of various treatments, affected cats can often maintain a good quality of life for several months or years. Most cats do not show signs of chronic kidney disease until 75 per cent of the kidneys have been damaged. Signs can vary between individuals but the most common signs are: 

 肾脏相关疾病是中老年猫常患疾病。不幸的是，对肾脏的损害是不可逆的，并且往往会继续恶化。但是，经过多种治疗，患猫还是能够高质量的存活几个月甚至是几年的。很多猫并不会表现表现出慢性肾病的症状，直到其百分之七十五的肾脏都遭受损害才会有症状。具体的表现因猫而异，但主要是：

. increased thirst 

· 饮水增加

. passing more urine 

· 排尿增加

. poor appetite 

· 食欲减退

. weight loss 

· 体重降低

. poor coat condition 

· 被毛状态差

. vomiting 

· 呕吐

. lethargy 

· 无精打采

. depression 

· 消沉

. bad breath 

· 呼吸困难


Many vets will try to diagnose kidney disease in its early stages, before clinical signs develop, by offering cat owners the option of urine and blood tests for their older cats at routine check-ups or vaccinations. By doing this, early dietary management or other treatment may significantly extend an affected cat’s life expectancy and quality of life. For more information on diagnosis and treatment see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Kidney or renal disease. 

 很多兽医都会在定期体检、免疫的时候给老年猫的主人提供相关的尿检血检，来在临床症状出现前发现并确诊早期肾病。这样早期进行饮食调节或是其他治疗能够显著的提升猫的生存质量和预期。需要更多信息，请参阅猫咪保护医学指导之肾脏泌尿疾病篇。

Cancer 癌症

Cats can develop different types of tumours which may either be benign – not usually harmful – or malignant – faster growing and usually harmful. Sometimes the tumours can spread to other areas of the body. It is a good idea to regularly feel all over your cat’s body for any lumps or bumps. Other signs of cancer vary dependent on the organ affected, but can include weight loss, increased thirst, passing more urine, depression, poor coat condition, vomiting and/or diarrhoea. 

 猫可能罹患多种不同的肿瘤，可能是良性不具备太大伤害的，也可能是恶性快速发展有很大危害的。有时候肿瘤会扩散到身体其他区域。

Arthritis arthritis

The term ‘arthritis’ means inflammation of the joint and this condition is extremely common in cats. However, it often goes unnoticed as owners think the cat is just slowing down with age, when it is actually a very painful condition. It is worth getting your cat checked regularly as treating chronic problems like arthritis will make a huge difference to their quality of life. The main signs shown in cats are: 

“关节炎”指的是关节部位的炎症，在猫身上非常常见。但是，如果主人没意识到这点而是仅仅认为是猫的衰老导致的，这对猫就是极为痛苦的折磨了。经常带你的猫去体检，并且对关节炎这种慢性病的治疗能够给猫的生活质量带来极大的提高。关节炎的主要症状是：

. a change in behaviour, for example: 
· 行为变化，比如：

. grumpiness, reduced interaction or tolerance with people – the discomfort associated with arthritis can be a cause of aggression in cats 
· 跛脚、与人的互动减少，不耐烦。关节炎带来的不适感可能会导致猫具有攻击性。

. not using the litter tray if the sides of the tray are too high for your cat to easily get into 
· 如果猫砂盆对于猫过高，那就不用猫砂盆。

. reduced interest in play 
· 不是那么喜欢玩耍

. difficulty grooming, especially the middle of the back and tail 
· 较难自己梳毛，尤其是后背中部和尾巴

. increased stiffness immediately after resting which gets better with movement 
· 休息过后身体僵硬，运动过后症状减轻

. stiffness, lameness and reduced mobility – an unwillingness to jump or climb 
· 僵硬、跛脚、活动量减少，不愿意跳跃攀爬

If your cat is overweight, this can make arthritis worse so it is very important to ensure they maintain an ideal weight. Regular, moderate exercise will also help – play is the best way to achieve this. 

如果你的猫超重，那可能会让关节炎更为严重。所以保持猫的体重很重要。一般来说，适度的运动会有助于保持体重，玩耍是最好的方式。

Arthritis is an ongoing problem and cannot be cured. However, in many cases it can be managed successfully allowing your cat to be mobile, pain-free and to lead a reasonably active life. For more information see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Arthritis. 

关节炎是持续性的疾病，不能被完全治愈。然而很多情况下能够被完美控制，让你的猫能够自由运动，不受疼痛的折磨，主动活跃的生活。需要更多信息，请参见猫咪保护医学指导之关节炎篇。

Hypertension 高血压

In cats, high blood pressure – known as hypertension – often occurs in association with another underlying disease – for example, cats suffering from kidney disease or hyperthyroidism often have some degree of hypertension as well. It can also occur as a primary problem in itself. The organs most vulnerable to the effects of high blood pressure are the eyes, kidneys, heart and brain. Initially there may be very few signs of high blood pressure, particularly if it is the primary problem but sometimes the signs can occur very suddenly. Signs of hypertension include: 
猫的高血压通常和另一种潜藏的疾病同时发生。比如罹患肾病或者是甲亢的猫通常也会有一定程度的高血压。高血压单独也可能成为严重的问题。对高血压最不耐受的器官是眼睛、肾脏、心脏和脑部。一开始高血压并不会有很多症状，尤其是当其单独发生的时候。不过有的时候高血压的症状会突然出现，包括：

. blindness 
· 失明

. changes inside the eye, including bleeding 
· 眼部变化，包括流血

. disorientation 
· 不适

. seizures 
· 抽搐

Many cats can go on to lead relatively normal lives following diagnosis and stabilisation of hypertension, but this will depend on the type and severity of any underlying disease. If left untreated, these signs can become permanent so seek veterinary advice as soon as possible. For more information see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Hypertension. 

很多猫在经过诊断和稳定血压之后能够过上相对正常的生活。不过这依然取决于是否有潜在疾病，以及疾病的类型和严重程度。如果不加以治疗，这些症状可能会常态化存在。所以需要尽早就医。需要更多信息，请参见猫咪保护医学指导之高血压篇。

Cat-friendly homes for the elderly feline 对老年猫友好的家庭环境

There are a number of small changes that can be made to your home which will have a big impact on the quality of your cat’s life. While a number of older cats appear to be ‘as young as they feel’ with many still showing kitten-like behaviours, others can benefit from a few home tweaks that ensure that all their resources are within easy reach. 

有一些很细微但是能够很大程度上提升你家猫的生活质量的小事你可以做。尽管有的老年猫看起来和幼猫没有分别，有的甚至还有幼猫的行为习惯。但它们确实能够从一些措施中受益，更容易获得它们所需的资源，

What you can do to help an older cat 
对于老年猫你能做的

Microchip 芯片

Make sure your cat is microchipped in case they become disorientated or goes missing. A microchip carries a unique number linked to a database holding your contact details, allowing you to be quickly traced should they stray and be scanned. See Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Microchipping for more information. 

确保你的猫已经植入芯片，这是为了预防它们走失或者走丢。芯片载有独一无二的编号，能够对应到你在数据库中的联系方式。这样一旦它们流浪并被扫描，你就能够被第一时间找到。请参阅猫咪保护基础指导之芯片篇。

Beds 猫窝

Allow your cat to reach favourite places to rest by strategically placing boxes or items of furniture for them to climb. Make sure they have a variety of cosy, well-padded beds in safe warm places that can be readily accessed. Your cat may enjoy the hammock-style radiator beds as they are very warm. 

有选择的摆放箱子以及家具，让猫能够自由攀爬到它们喜欢的地方进行休息。确保它们在安全温暖的环境下能够有很多舒适、结实的猫窝可供随时休息。你的猫可能会喜欢吊床式的猫窝，因为比较暖和。

Somewhere to perch up high 能够够到的高处

Older cats can find it difficult to make accurate calculations when jumping and are not as agile as they used to be, especially if they are stiff, in pain or have arthritis. Provide easy ways for cats to access their favourite areas, such as using a ramp or small foot stool to give them access to high surfaces. Make sure it is wide enough and you could also cover it in carpet to give extra grip. It is a good idea to fashion some sort of crash mat underneath the ramp, in case the cat falls. Cushions under windowsills act as crash mats for uncoordinated or wobbly cats. 

老年猫，尤其是那些有些躯体僵硬、遭受痛苦或者是有关节炎的猫，已经不像它们年轻的时候那么灵活敏捷，在跳跃的时候可能会不能做出准确的预判。为猫提供方便进入他们喜欢区域的方式，例如使用坡道或小脚凳使他们能够进入高处。确保这些通道足够宽，并且盖上毯子，以提供额外的抓地力。 如果猫不慎落下，最好在坡道下面安装某种防撞垫。 窗台下放置靠垫可作为活动不协调的老年猫的防撞垫。

Litter trays and toileting 猫砂盆和排泄

Provide several litter trays in the house at all times, even if your cat has toileted outside all of their life. There are many occasions when an older cat will need an indoor litter tray, such as when it’s raining outside, if the normal toileting site has frozen over and is hard to dig, or if they feel intimidated by other neighbouring cats. Place the litter trays in quiet, safe areas of the home. 

即便你的猫一直在户外排泄，你也要在家中各个地点放置几个猫砂盆。很多状况下，老年猫需要在室内排泄，比如外面在下雨，或者是排泄场所冻冰很难挖坑，或者是猫被其他邻居的猫威胁。你需要把猫砂盆放置在安静而且安全的室内区域。

Providing a large tray gives the cat plenty of space to move around inside. Make sure the tray has a low side so they can get in and out more easily. Some litter types that were acceptable as an adult may be too coarse for older cats. Don’t make any sudden changes, but provide additional trays with 3cm of soft, fine litter that they will find more comfortable under their paws. 

大的猫砂盆能够给猫更多的空间。选择有一边相对低的猫砂盆，可以让猫进出更加容易。有的猫砂对于成年猫可能合适，但是对老年猫可能过于粗糙。你不需要做出立刻的改变，而是可以在边上放置额外的猫砂盆。里面放上3厘米厚、精细的猫砂。这样老年猫可能会更舒适。

Older cats are less able to defend themselves or a territory and as a result may become more anxious or dependant on their owners. Some cats will feel reassurance from owners that accompany them outside so they are protected against the neighbouring cats. 

老年猫自我防卫的能力减弱，守卫地盘的能力亦然。所以很可能会变得更为焦虑，或者是更加依赖主人。和主人一起在户外会使猫感到安抚，这能够抵御邻居的猫的威胁。

If your cat still prefers to toilet outside, provide a newly dug over border as close to the house as possible and maintain it regularly. 

如果你的猫仍然喜欢在外面排泄，你可以在尽量靠近房子的位置挖一道浅沟，并且经常维护。

Water and food bowls 食碗水碗

Place water and food bowls in a variety of easily accessible locations around the house, both upstairs and downstairs so they are easy to find and they don’t have to walk up and down stairs just to get food and water. Speak to your vet about the most appropriate diet for your older cat. 

在家中不同位置（包括楼上和楼下）放置水碗和食碗，这样猫就不需要上下楼获得食物和水。你的兽医能够为你的老年猫提供合适的食谱。

Playtime 玩耍

Older cats still like to play, but they need more gentle, brief games than when they were younger. Use toys that are unlikely to intimidate them, such as a feather attached to string that is slowly moved past them. Experiment with different toys to see what captures your cat’s attention. Even if they only watch or slowly swipes the toy with a paw, it is still important beneficial mental stimulation. 

老年猫也喜欢玩耍，但是相较于它们年轻的时候，现在可能更需要轻柔、简短的玩耍。你可以用威胁性小的玩具，比如绳子上拴着的羽毛在它们面前慢慢晃动。多试几种玩具来测试猫的喜好。即便猫只是看着，或者是慢慢用爪子拨弄玩具，这也是对猫很重要的精神刺激。

Regular grooming 日常梳理毛发

As older cats may struggle to look after their coats, additional help and gentle grooming will help to keep your cat’s skin healthy and gives you some valuable bonding time with your cat. Stroking a cat is a great de-stressor and may lower an owner’s blood pressure. 

老年猫虽然会很卖力的护理它们的被毛，但额外的梳毛会让其皮肤更加健康，也给你和猫之间提供宝贵的共处时间。抚摸一只猫是绝佳的减压方式，也有降低主人血压的功效。

Scratching posts 抓挠猫抓板

Cats may still want to scratch but can find it difficult as they age. You could provide a horizontal scratching post or one with a lower gradient and softer material such as carpet, which they may find easier. Remember to check their claws regularly. 

老年猫可能依然会去抓猫抓板，但是鉴于年龄可能会遇到困难。你可以给它们提供水平的或者坡度更小的猫抓板，更柔软的毯子也能让猫抓起来更容易。记住要定期检查它们的爪子的情况。

Routines 每日例程

Cats are creatures of habit and this characteristic becomes more pronounced as they age. They prefer a familiar, regular routine to provide predictability. Where possible, avoid moving furniture so that your cat’s environment is familiar and they can easily find their way around your home. 

猫是循规蹈矩的生物，这个特性随着年龄的增大愈发明显。它们喜欢相对静止的环境，这样能够很好地做出预判。尽量避免挪动家具，这样你的猫就能够轻容在家中找到适合的路径。

Veterinary care 医学护理

Seek veterinary advice early if you are worried. Remember, many of the disorders that affect older cats can be treated and managed to allow your cat a happy and content life, particularly when treatment is sought early. However, inevitably there may come a time when your cat is in continual pain, discomfort or distress, and the most loving and courageous way you can show them how much you care is to end their suffering. See Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: When to let go for further information. 

如果你感到担忧，请尽早寻求兽医的建议。很多困扰老年猫的问题，如果能够在早期进行治疗，是能够被控制的很好，让你的猫过上快乐舒适的生活的。然而，总有一天，你的猫会陷入持续性的痛苦、不适以及苦难。这时最需要爱和勇气的方式就是终结它们的痛苦。请参阅猫咪保护基础指导之何时放手篇。

Your elderly cat and you 老年猫和你

Caring for an older cat in their twilight years brings a tremendous joy and many owners actively decide to adopt an older cat because of the endearing qualities they can offer. With their wandering days behind them, older cats tend to stay closer to home and appreciate gentle affection. Owners often comment on the special relationship they have with their older pet, enhanced by some simple measures and an understanding of their needs. 

照顾一只处于迟暮之年的老年猫会给主人带来很多的乐趣。因为其拥有很多优秀品质，很多猫主人会有意收养老年猫。经历过冒险冲动的日子，老年猫更倾向于离家更近，也更容易和人建立情感联系。很多主人都会对和老年猫之间的奇特联系而赞叹不已。通过一些简单措施以及对老年猫需求的透彻了解能够增进这种主人和老年猫之间的奇妙联系。
