Indoor and outdoor cats 室内猫以及室外猫



Just like people, cats are all individuals. Some cats love going outside, some barely put a paw through the cat flap and others can’t go out at all, so wherever your cat spends their time, make sure they’re safe and happy. This guide will help you consider what is best for your feline companion and suggest ways to ensure they enjoy a good quality of life in their home environment. Please see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Feral cats for more guidance on feral cats. 

和人一样，猫也是独立的个体，有的猫特别喜欢往外跑，有的很少，而有的根本不想出去。无论它们想在家或者在外过活，你都需要确保它们的身体健康、心情愉悦。这个指导可以帮助你了解到如何更好的陪伴你的猫，并且保证他们的生活质量。对于野猫，你可以参见猫咪保护基础指导之野猫篇。

Regardless of whether your cat lives indoors only or has access to outdoors too, Cats Protection recommends that your cat is microchipped, neutered, vaccinated and provided with flea and worming treatment. You can speak to your vet for more information and guidance about your specific cat’s needs. 

无论你家的猫是单纯养在室内还是可以自由选择外出，Cat Protection都建议你对其完成“芯片植入”“绝育”“疫苗免疫”“定期驱虫”这一套流程。你可以从兽医处了解到猫的需求方面更多信息。

The great outdoors 益处多多的户外

Ideally all cats would be allowed access to outdoors to express their natural behaviour and in the UK, the majority of people let their cats go outside. However, in built-up areas, there can be a large number of cats, each with a dwindling territory size and many people are choosing to keep their cats inside. In addition, it is recommended that some cats are kept indoors for their own benefit. Cats have a natural tendency to explore so allowing them access to the outside world gives them mental stimulation and reduces stress. If they are kept solely indoors, some additional considerations for their home are recommended. 

理想状况下所有的猫都能被允许出门释放其自然天性。在英国，绝大部分人让猫自由外出。无论如何，在城市中，猫的数量很多，同时它们各自也会有领地范围。很多人都逐渐考虑把自己的猫养在室内。另外，出于对一些猫的情况考虑，最好是将其养在室内。猫有自由探索的天性，让它们能够外出，可以保持其精神愉悦，减少焦虑。如果猫被孤独的圈养在家里，则需要额外为它们考虑一些。

Outdoor benefits 户外的好处

Bigger territory – allowing your cat outdoor access not only increases the space available to them, but also the variety of environment 
更大的领地 - 让你的猫能够自由外出，不光是扩大了其活动的区域，也丰富了它活动区域的种类。

Natural behaviour – cats with outdoor access are able to express their natural behaviour and can do so in a setting that is more ‘acceptable’ to the owner. For example, scratching and spraying are normal behaviours for cats and these traits often go unnoticed by owners of cats that have outdoor access. 
自然的天性 - 能够出门的猫会有机会展现其天性，而在外撒野也更能被主人容忍。举例来说，抓挠东西以及喷尿对猫来说可能是正常的行为，但是对于能够自由外出的猫的主人来说，往往看不到。

Rodent control – cats can help to keep unwanted rodents at bay as well as express important natural cat behaviour. The hunting sequence of stalking and catching prey actually releases endorphins or ‘happy hormones’ in the cat’s brain. Hunting behaviour is not influenced by hunger – many cats with ample food will still want to hunt 
控制鼠患 - 猫在释放捕鼠天性的同时也能够很好地控制鼠群的数量。猫“跟踪、捕获”猎物的过程中会释放内啡肽，让猫感到愉悦。狩猎的行为与饥饿无关，很多不缺吃喝的猫也会想要狩猎。

An interesting environment – the outdoor environment is a complex mix of different smells, sights, sounds, tastes and textures that is constantly changing. It is particularly stimulating and interesting for the cat’s extraordinary senses and provides them with an important mental workout Exercise – cats with outdoor access are able to exercise more readily, either through hunting, climbing trees and fences or simply by having the extra space to utilise. Cats have great agility and engaging in a variety of different types of exercise helps to keep their muscles toned. Active cats are much less likely to become obese and suffer from associated health problems 
为猫提供更有趣的环境 - 户外环境中气味、光线、声音、味道、纹理都更加复杂多变。对于感官极度发达的猫来说，这是相当好的刺激手段。能够让它们在精神上很好地得到锻炼。能够外出的猫能够通过狩猎、爬树、爬栏杆或者是在宽敞的空间内活动来施展自我。能够保持其敏捷性，肌肉不退化。积极活跃的猫更不容易变胖、生病。

Enables escape from the household if necessary – there are occasions when cats need personal space and the ability to escape from anything that they perceive as stressful, or a threat. This could include a conflict with other cats or other pets in the household, building work in the home, or unfamiliar visitors in the house. Unrestricted access to outdoors, such as via a cat flap, provides an escape route. Microchip or magnetic cat flaps can help to provide your cat with security so that neighbouring cats do not enter your house 
能够逃离家庭 - 有的时候猫需要隐蔽的空间，逃离它认为有威胁的事物。可能是猫之间的冲突，也可能是家里的装修作业，或者是家里来的陌生访客。而能够自由外出，则可以为猫提供一个逃跑的路径。芯片识别猫门或者是磁性的猫门都能够防止其他猫进入屋子，避免你的猫受到威胁。

Outdoor risks 户外的危险

Injuries – many cats are injured or killed on the road each year. Often these cats are young – under a year old – and some studies show that more road traffic injuries happen at night. It is not just busy roads that can cause cats to be injured or killed, but also quiet country roads that only have a few cars passing through which can catch a cat off guard. It is thought cats may cope better with consistently busy roads than those that are only used at rush hour 
受伤 - 每年都有很多猫在路上受伤或者丧命。通常这些猫中很多都是小于一岁的幼猫，而且调查显示，夜间交通事故造成猫受伤的情况更为常见。不只是车流量大的道路会致使猫受伤、死亡，很多小路上由于猫警惕性不高也会造成事故。通常认为，猫更能适应车来车往的道路，而非偶尔车流量增大的道路。

Cats can also become injured through contact with other cats, dogs and humans. Fighting can be reduced by neutering, but cat fights may still occur, often when a new cat moves into the area. Many cats sharing territories learn to ‘time share’ so that one will use the area in the morning and another in the afternoon 
猫可能会在和其他猫、狗、人接触的过程中受伤。你可以通过给猫绝育来减少其打斗的冲动，但是打斗不会就此停止。当其他猫进入它的地盘时，还是会发生冲突的。很多猫会分时间共享地盘。比如一只猫会在早上在这一区域活动，而另一只会在下午在这一区域活动。

Disease – cats can contract infectious diseases through contact and fighting with other cats, as well as from the outdoor environment. Vaccination can protect your cat against many of these diseases 
疾病 - 猫在和其他猫打斗的过程中或者从户外环境中都可能会染上传染病。进行疫苗免疫可以避免猫患上很多传染病。

Parasites – cats can pick up parasites such as fleas, ticks and a variety of internal worms. Speak to your vet to find out how to prevent and treat parasites. Bear in mind indoor cats can also be susceptible if not treated regularly 
寄生虫 - 猫可能会染上跳蚤、虱子以及一系列内部寄生虫。你可以和兽医了解如何防治。要记住，如果不经常驱虫，室内的猫也可能会染上这些寄生虫的。

Loss – cats can go missing for a variety of reasons, such as becoming lost, or trapped in a garden shed or garage, or sometimes having moved in with someone else. Cats are sometimes fed by people mistaking them for strays, or are handed in to animal charities. 
丢失 - 猫可能以为很多原因失踪，比如走失、被关住、或者是被别人圈养。有的时候猫会被别人当做流浪猫喂食，或者是被送往动物福利机构。

Microchipping your cat is important and helps to reunite you with your cat in the event that they ever goes missing. Speak to your vet for more information if your cat is not microchipped already. Before you let your cat outside for the first time, make sure they have fully adapted to their new home, regardless of whether they are new to you or you have recently moved house 
在每次猫走丢的时候，给猫植入的芯片能够帮助你快速找到猫。如果你的猫还没被植入过芯片，那你可以和兽医了解更多。在第一次让猫出门之前，一定要确保它已经完全适应了新家，无论是刚搬家还是刚来到你家。

Outdoor poisons – if you suspect your cat may have ingested poison, seek veterinary advice urgently – don’t wait for signs of ill health as delays of even an hour can cost lives. Common poisons that cats can come into contact with include slug pellets, garden chemicals, anti-freeze and rodent control poisons, including eating poisoned prey. Outdoor chemicals should be stored out of reach. There are a number of garden plants that can be harmful or toxic to cats. Bear in mind there are also indoor chemicals and plants which can pose a risk 
户外的毒物 - 如果你怀疑自己的猫吃了有毒的物质，请立刻咨询医嘱。不要等猫表现出生病的迹象再找兽医，延误的每一秒都可能让猫丧命。猫容易接触到的毒物包括杀虫剂、防冻液、鼠药，以及被鼠药毒死的死老鼠。放在户外的化学品请妥善存放，另外一些花园种植的植物也可能对猫有伤害。记住室内的化学制品以及植物同样可能会对猫造成伤害。

Minimising the risks for an outdoor cat 最大程度减小户外猫的风险

Before worrying about the risks of letting your cat outdoors, remember there are many ways in which you can minimise them. 
在抱怨放猫出门的危害之前，你需要了解到，有很多途径可以最小化这些风险。

. Keep your cat indoors at night to protect them from the hazards of the roads. A reflective or fluorescent quick release collar may help get them seen, particularly in the winter months when it gets dark earlier. However, collars themselves are not without risk, so ensure it fits properly on a regular basis. Two fingers should fit snugly between the collar and the cat’s neck and it should have a quick release fitting to prevent your cat becoming ensnared or getting their leg trapped. Collars with tags also do not provide a permanent means of identification 
· 在晚上避免猫外出，以此来规避可能的交通危险。给猫佩戴荧光或者是反光的颈圈能够让它们尤其在冬季天黑的比较早的时候能够更醒目。然而，佩戴颈圈确实有风险，所以你需要确保颈圈的适合程度。颈圈应该能刚好容纳两根手指。并且应该能够在猫被缠住或者是绊住腿的时候自动脱落。因此就算颈圈带有名字标签，也不意味着能够长期起到标识的作用。

. Collar-fitted tracker devices are a popular idea to keep track of your cat, but the welfare implications must be considered – size, weight, and any risk of entrapment and/or impeding the quick release collar. Also consider how practical or useful they may be such as battery life, geographical range, how tracking data is sourced as well as the fact they are not permanent 
在颈圈上安装定位设备是很常见的做法，但是需要考虑这样做是不是会对猫的生活造成影响。定位设备的大小、重量，是否会引发缠绊，是否会影响颈圈安全扣的开启。另外也需要考虑电池寿命，监控范围，以及监控数据的来源等因素。

. Have your cat microchipped – this is a permanent means of identification and will greatly increase your chance of being reunited with them should they go missing 
· 给猫植入芯片 - 这是永久性的标记猫的方法，能够极大程度提高猫走丢后被找回的概率。

. Ensure that your cat is neutered to reduce roaming 
· 给猫绝育，避免暴走。

. Regularly treat your cat for fleas and worms and ensure they are up to date with their vaccinations. Speak to your vet for more information 
· 定期驱虫，免疫。

. If you are concerned about your cat going outside, you could consider enclosing your garden to provide a safe area for your cat to enjoy some fresh air 
· 如果你对放猫外出感到不安全，那可以考虑把花园封闭起来给猫提供一个安全的、能够呼吸新鲜空气的空间。


Cats and wildlife 猫和野生动物

Cats’ hunting behaviour varies between individuals – some cats are prolific hunters while others catch nothing at all. There is no evidence that cats are having an impact on the bird population, as they usually catch sick or weak birds. Here are some steps you can take to help minimise your cat preying on birds in the garden: 

猫的狩猎行为在各个个体上表现不同。有的猫特别能狩猎，而有的则不行。没有证据能够表明猫的狩猎能够影响鸟类的数量。猫抓到的通常是病鸟或者是身体虚弱的鸟。以下是能够避免你的猫在花园猎鸟的一些建议：

. you can still feed birds by using a high bird table or feeder away from any platforms which a cat could use to pounce on them. Research indicates that feeding birds can actually reduce the number caught by cats, as the more birds that are present, the more chance there is of a cat being spotted and the birds calling a warning 
· 你仍然可以用很高的喂食器给鸟喂食，但是需要注意附近不要有猫能够借力跃起扑咬的任何平台。研究显示，给鸟类喂食能够实际上减少鸟被猫狩猎的数量，因为越多的鸟来进食，猫的狩猎越可能被提前发现，进而引起警惕。

. placing an uncomfortable surface around the base will stop cats sitting underneath it 
· 在喂鸟器下方使用让猫不舒服的材质，这样猫就不会在喂鸟器下方久留。

. making the table stand slippery will prevent cats from climbing it – a metal post is a good option 
· 选择光滑的支柱往往能够避免猫攀爬喂鸟器。比如金属的支柱就是个很好的选择。

. position nest boxes where cats cannot reach them 
· 把人造鸟巢放置在猫够不到的地方。

. if possible, keep your cat indoors during the early morning and evening when birds are at their most active 
· 如果可能，你可以在鸟类最活跃的清晨以及夜晚把猫关在屋子里。


Allowing your cat to enjoy their outdoor environment 让你的猫能够享受户外

It can be hard to keep your cat to the confines of your garden, but you’ll want to encourage your cat to stay close to home to keep them safe. So, is there anything you can do? Providing a cat-friendly garden may help. 

你很难把猫仅仅关在花园里不让它出去，但是你又不想它们走太远受到伤害。所以你能做的，是给猫营造一个合适的花园。

Providing an inviting toilet area 营造一个适合排泄的区域

Cats like somewhere soft to bury their faeces and will be drawn to newly-dug soil, sand or gravel. To prevent them messing up your neighbour’s flower beds, you could try the following: 

猫喜欢柔软的介质这样能够方便的掩埋排泄物。新疏松过的泥土、沙子或者是砂砾都可以。为了不让你的猫祸害邻居的花床，你可以采取以下措施：

. provide them with a litter tray in the house and/or 
· 在屋子里放置一个猫砂盆。

. provide them with their own toilet area in the garden, in a secluded, sheltered area of well-dug, fine soil. You could add some cat litter to encourage them to toilet there. Make sure it’s dug over regularly so it remains hygienic and allowing the soiled material to decompose naturally. Ensure it is placed somewhere private where they feel safe 
· 在花园内准备一个僻静、有遮挡的、土壤蓬松的区域，供它们排泄。你可以额外放一些猫砂，这样它们或许能更加喜欢在那排泄。你需要经常性的翻土，这样来维持这个区域的卫生，让被污染的土壤能够自然分解。

Fencing 围栏

Cats are great climbers and jump over most fences. However, a two-metre high, close boarded fence, together with a hedge parallel to the fence, will encourage your cat to remain within your garden. Angled trellis, netting, taut wire or string could be put on top of the fence as a further deterrent, but make sure your cat cannot become ensnared or injured. 

猫的攀爬能力很强，嫩能够跃过绝大部分栏杆。但是，如果你把两米高的围栏外再种植一圈灌木，应该就能让猫更倾向于留在花园里。更进一步，你可以将有角度的格子、网、拉紧的线或绳子放在围栏的顶部，但要确保你的猫不会因此陷入陷阱或受伤。

Planting 种植

You may want to consider dedicating a corner in your garden specifically for your cat away from your wildlife feeding or nesting areas. In this space you could plant all those ‘cat-friendly’ plants such as catnip (Nepeta cataria), mint, cat thyme (Teucrium marum) and lavender. A patch of longer grass can provide a soft bed and cats may also nibble on it to help cough up hairballs. Plants – without thorns – can be placed to give your cat a shady spot to lie in during those hot and sunny days while logs provide excellent outdoor scratching posts. Many cats can feel threatened in exposed spaces, so ensure your cat has plenty of hiding and resting areas in the garden. 

你可能会考虑在花园中专门为猫提供猫窝，这个猫窝需要远离野生动物投喂筑巢的地点。在猫窝附近，你可以种植猫喜欢的植物，比如猫薄荷（荆芥）、薄荷、猫百里香（Teucrium marum）和薰衣草。 一片较长的草可以是猫供柔软的床，猫也可以通过啃食草来咳出毛球。 种植植物（不是荆棘）可以让你的猫在阳光充足的日子里躺在阴凉的地方，放置木桩则提供了极好的户外猫抓板。 许多猫在暴露的空间中会感到受到威胁，因此你需要确认猫在花园中有足够的隐藏和休息区。

Other cats 其他猫

If your cat is nervous about going outside, place some pot plants or other objects just outside the cat flap to provide hiding places they can use to survey the area. A magnetic or microchip cat flap can keep neighbour’s cats out of your home. For more information, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Microchipping. To discourage other cats from entering the garden 
– try clapping your hands or using a gentle water pistol. Try to discourage other cats from coming into, or overlooking your garden – sheds and walls are favoured areas – as this can be very threatening for anxious cats. 

如果你的猫胆小不敢外出，那可以在猫门外放置一些盆栽植物或者是其他物体，这样能够为猫提供藏身之所。磁性或者芯片识别的猫门能够阻止邻居家的猫进入。如果需要驱赶其他猫进入花园，你可以拍手或者是用小型的呲水枪。你需要阻止其他猫进入或者是窥探你的花园，尤其是棚屋以及墙壁，这样能够避免你的猫感受到威胁。

Indoor life 猫的室内生活

Ideally all cats would be allowed access to the outdoors to express their natural behaviour. However, cats can adapt to living indoors, particularly if they are used to it from a young age. Some cats need to be confined indoors due to medical conditions and others prefer an indoor life. If they become bored they may develop behaviour problems so there are a number of ways to keep your cat happy: 

理想状况下所有的猫都应该能够出门释放天性。但是，猫其实可以适应室内的生活。尤其是那些年幼时候就曾经在室内生活的猫。有的猫是因为健康的原因需要被强制关在屋子里，而有的猫则是倾向不出门。猫在家里如果感到无聊，可能会产生行为方面的问题，需要你用一下方式不断让猫保持活力：

Keep them occupied… 让猫一直活跃

Domestic cats that have free access to the outdoors will still often engage in hunting activity even if there is no access to prey – eg playing with fallen leaves, or grass blowing in the wind. 

能够自由出门的猫通常会保持狩猎的活跃状态，即便没有猎物，也可以通过追逐落叶或者是草来活动。

It is important to allow cats opportunities to exhibit hunting behaviour, as it keeps them mentally stimulated and releases feel-good hormones called endorphins. Indoor cats aren’t able to play outside, so it is important to provide them with toys and activities to keep them occupied.

让猫能够施展狩猎天性很重要，这样它们能够保持精神活跃，并且释放让猫感到愉悦的内啡肽。养在室内的猫不能出去玩，所以你需要用玩具来保持它们精神活跃不枯燥。

If you are out of the house all day, you might consider getting two cats. They may keep each other company and stop each other from becoming bored. However, while this set up can work well if the two cats have been brought up together, this is not a guarantee. Even some siblings may prefer not to remain together once they reach adulthood. 

如果你白天都外出不在家，那最好是考虑养两只猫。这样互相有个伴能够避免无聊。但是，这种做法需要两只猫能够和谐共处。这可不是一件容易事。即使是一窝的小猫，在长大后都不一定会和睦相处。

If you do introduce a new cat to your home, it is critical to do this slowly and carefully to avoid lifelong tension which may lead to behavioural issues and conflict. If the two cats do not get along, it can be even more stressful for them if they are confined indoors and can never escape each other. See Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Cats living together. 

如果你需要新养一只猫，请一定谨慎让它们互相接受彼此，否则可能会引发很多行为问题。如果两只猫不能很好相处，那把它们留在室内不能互相逃离将会导致更严重的冲突。参见猫咪保护基础指导之猫群居篇。

Indoor benefits 室内养猫的好处

. Your cat will be protected from loss or outdoor hazards, such as road accidents, physical attacks from other animals and outdoor poisons, if they are kept solely indoors 

· 单纯养在室内，你的猫不会有走丢的风险，也不会受到车祸、其他动物的袭击、户外有毒物质的伤害。

. Your cat may be less likely to contract parasites or infectious disease through not having direct contact with other cats or the environment used by cats or other animals 

· 因为没有接触其他动物或其他动物所生活的环境，你的猫更不容易染上寄生虫或者是传染病。

. Your cat won’t hunt if kept solely indoors – assuming your house is rodent-proof – however, opportunities to play and express hunting behaviour must still be given 

· 如果你家没有老鼠的话，猫不会去狩猎。但是一定要给猫自由释放狩猎行为的空间。



Indoor risks 室内养猫的风险

. If they are not allowed outdoor access, your cat may suffer from frustration if they are unable to exhibit their natural behaviour. This may lead to various behavioural issues – depending on a number of factors, including the home environment, relationship and density of other cats in the home and the character of the cat. Examples of behavioural problems include scratching furniture, spraying, over grooming, aggression, house soiling and depression 

· 如果不能出门，你的猫可能因为不能展露天性而感到无聊。基于不同的因素（家庭环境、猫的数量以及之间的关系）这可能会导致一系列行为问题。猫可能出现抓挠家具、喷尿、过度清洁、暴躁易怒、污染房屋以及过度沮丧等问题。

. While cats like some predictability about their environment, a static environment can be detrimental. Some indoor cats can develop fear of change, becoming sensitive to any differences within their small territory. These cats become more dependent on routine than the average cat 

· 尽管猫喜欢相对稳定的环境，但是完全不变的环境也是有害的。有的养在室内的猫会形成对变化的恐惧，会对自己小领地出现的任何不同超级敏感。这些猫比平常的猫要更加依赖日常环境。

. Your cat will be unable to hunt if kept solely indoors and will lose this mental stimulation. It may be more difficult for a cat to adjust to life indoors if they were once a prolific hunter or enjoyed the great outdoors 

· 猫独自被养在室内不能够进行狩猎，也就没有了狩猎的精神刺激。这对于之前曾经是优秀猎手而且享受户外生活的猫来说可能很难接受。

. If they don’t have outside access, your cat may not be able to escape from disruption such as building works, visitors or other pets in the household. While cats in multi-cat households with outdoor access can get some personal space, indoor-only cats may be stressed from living together in a restricted territory. See Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Cats living together for further information 

· 既然不能出门，那你的猫可能就会失去躲避装修、陌生访客或者是其他宠物的途径。在一个多猫家庭中，能够自由外出的猫能够有更多的自我空间。只养在室内的猫则会因为在一个小空间内生存而矛盾重重。参见猫咪保护基础指导之猫群居篇。

. Cats confined indoors are not necessarily free from the risk of stress caused by other cats in the neighbourhood. A cat that can see another feline through a window can still be stressed by the presence of the cat within its territory and develop behavioural issues 

· 就算养在室内，也不能完全保证你的猫不会被邻居的猫威胁到。能够远距离看到其他猫的存在就可能会使这只猫感到受威胁，进而引发行为问题。

. Other hazards to be aware of: 

· 其他需要注意的危险：

. indoor hazards – It’s important to remember to keep cupboards, washing machines and tumble driers closed. Toilet lids should be kept down to avoid any risk of drowning. Balconies and windows should be safely fenced over with strong wire mesh or screens, making sure there are no gaps that your cat could fall through 

· 室内的危险：你需要确保碗柜、洗衣机以及干衣机保持关闭。马桶盖应该保持关闭状态避免猫溺水。阳台以及窗户应该用坚固的丝网封闭，确保猫不会从缝隙中掉落。

. 	houseplants – some plants and flowers – particularly lilies – can be toxic to cats. It’s probably best to ensure you don’t have plants that are dangerous to cats in your home, or certainly not within your cats’ reach 

· 家庭种植的一些植物以及花卉，尤其是百合，对猫是有毒性的。你需要确保家里没有对猫有害的植物，或者是让猫不能够接触到这些植物。

. household products – cats are very susceptible to poisoning. A number of everyday household items can pose a danger to cats and should be kept safely away – for further information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide – Keeping your cat safe 

· 家用化学品：猫对毒性物质很敏感。日常生活中很多常见的化学品都可能对猫造成伤害，应当小心放置。需要更多信息请参阅猫咪保护基础指导之保障你的猫的安全篇。

. inactivity and obesity – indoor cats need to be provided with opportunities to exercise to avoid them getting fat or inactive which can lead to other health issues 

· 不活跃以及肥胖：室内猫需要有机会锻炼身体，这样能够避免发胖、没精神引发其他健康问题。

. over-dependence – a solitary indoor cat will rely on its owner to provide stimulation, companionship and exercise and can become over-dependent 

· 过度依赖。孤单的养在室内的猫可能会因为过于依赖主人的陪伴、玩耍而造成过度依赖。

. escape – keeping windows and doors shut to prevent an indoor cat escaping can be difficult in busy households. If the cat does get out, they’ll be highly stressed and disorientated as they’ll have no experience of the outdoor environment. It is recommended that you microchip your cat, even if they live indoors to increase the chance of them being reunited with you if they go missing 

· 逃跑。在忙碌的家庭中，随时保持门窗紧闭避免猫逃跑是很难做到的。如果猫确实跑出去了，那么它很可能会因为毫无室外经验而遭受很大压力。就算养在室内，我们也建议你给猫植入芯片，这样能够提高猫一旦走失后找回的概率。

Enhancing and maximising the indoor environment for all cats 提升多猫家庭的室内环境

Cats should be provided with a stimulating and safe indoor environment, whether they go outside or not. If your cat is solely kept indoors, then this is particularly essential. If you have more than one cat, offer enough resources in different locations where your cats can eat, drink, toilet, rest and hide. See Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Cats living together for further guidance. 

无论猫是否能够外出，你都应该为其提供一个安全、有趣的室内环境。如果你的猫是单纯养在室内的，那室内环境的营造尤为重要。如果你有不止一只猫，那你必须在不同地点放置足够多的猫粮、水、猫砂等资源，确保每只猫都能找到地点进食、饮水、如厕、歇息和隐藏。参阅猫咪保护基础指导之群居的猫篇。

Feeding and drinking 喂食以及饮水

Cats like to eat and drink away from their litter tray, as understandably, it’s more hygienic. However, many people don’t realise that cats also like to have each of their food and water bowls in separate places too. This stems back to the cat’s evolutionary past, when they would eat in a different area to avoid contaminating their drinking source with the remains of their prey. 

理所当然，猫喜欢在远离猫砂盆的地方进食和饮水，这样更为清洁。不过，很多人都不知道猫的食物和水都要单独放置才好。这种需求源自猫额祖先，在远离水源的地方进食能够避免猎物残骸污染水源。

Avoid putting food and water bowls next to each other. Eating and drinking can be vulnerable activities for a cat – so try placing bowls slightly away from the wall, so that a cat can sit with their back to the wall and view their surroundings. Cats are all individuals and therefore have difference preferences for types of bowls, for example plastic, ceramic or metal bowls. 

避免把食碗和水碗房子一起。进食和饮水对于猫是有风险的活动。因此将碗放在稍稍远离墙壁的地方能够让猫背靠墙壁进食或者进水，这样就能够同时监控周围情况。猫个体性很强。因此对食碗的材质也各有偏好，有的喜欢塑料的，有的喜欢陶瓷的，还有的喜欢金属的。

Play and exercise 玩耍以及锻炼

Keep your cat amused with toys, climbing towers or activity centres. These can be bought or made – a cardboard box with holes cut into it or a ball of tin foil can be perfectly adequate. Play is more fun if you get involved too – you can use fishing rod toys with feathers on a string to mimic their prey! Opportunities to exhibit hunting behaviour are often triggered by toys which move and attract the cat’s attention. Older cats will love playing three or four times a day, but the type of play may need to be adapted to suit their needs and level of mobility. For more information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Elderly cats. 

你可以用猫玩具、猫爬架或其他玩具来保持猫的兴奋状态。这些玩具可以购置也能自制，把纸箱掏孔或者把铝箔团成团，都可以是很好的玩具。如果有你的参与，那就会更为有趣，你可以用挂有羽毛的逗猫棒来模拟它们的猎物。来回晃动的玩具能够吸引猫的注意力，使其展示出狩猎的行为。老年猫每天需要玩耍三到四次。当然这种玩耍需要适配它们的需求和活动量。需要更多信息，请参阅猫咪保护基础指导之老年猫篇。

Younger cats will be happy to play 10 times a day or more. Very short games of one to two minutes are fine – cats use their energy in short bursts when hunting, so try to mimic this. Create interest at meal times by hiding biscuits around the house for your cat to find. Make a pyramid out of cardboard toilet roll tubes and hide food in the tubes, or use a puzzle ball. Swap toys around regularly to keep them interesting. 

幼猫可能每天需要玩耍十次甚至更多。每次一两分钟的玩耍就足够。幼猫会在狩猎猛扑的过程中消耗足够多的能量。所以短时间的玩耍就足够模拟这种过程。你可以在喂食时间在房间各处藏匿好食物，让猫自己发现。或者你可以用硬纸筒搭一个金字塔，并且把食物放在里面。或者用喂食球。你可以定期变换玩具的位置，来保持其对猫的吸引力。


Somewhere to hide 能隐藏的场所

It is important to always provide your cat with an easily accessible place to hide which will help to make them feel safe and secure. A hiding place can be something as simple as a cardboard box on its side, or upside down with large holes for access. Alternatively, you could purchase an igloo style cat bed, or offer space under the bed or in a wardrobe with the door left ajar. The cat shouldn’t be disturbed while they are hiding. 

对于猫来说，有个能够随时躲藏、能够让它们感到安全的场所相当重要。这个安全场所可以是简单在外侧开孔的纸箱。也可以是买来的雪屋式的猫窝，或者也可能是床下的空间，或者是柜门打开的碗柜。在躲藏状态的猫最好不要被惊动。

Somewhere to get up high 能够登高的场所

Cats feel safer if they can view their surroundings from a height and this also increases their territory by providing extra vertical space that they can use. This is a common coping mechanism for cats that feel anxious or fearful. You could place a cosy blanket on top of a wardrobe and provide access by placing a stool or similar item next to it. Cats also love to sit on window sills and shelves. Extra consideration should be given to elderly cats. For more information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Elderly cats. 

如果能够在高处环视四周，猫通常都会感到更加安全并且这也会给猫提供额外的垂直方向的空间。对于感到焦虑和恐惧的猫来说，这是一种相当普适的做法。你可以在碗柜的顶部放一个比较舒适的笼子，并且在附近放一个猫爬架或者类似的东西，让猫能够很容易的上去。猫同样喜欢在窗户边上以及柜子上坐着对于老年猫来说，你应该更多的考虑更多，请参阅猫咪保护基础指导之老年猫篇。

Sleeping 休息

On average, cats spend about 16 hours a day sleeping. Cats generally rest or sleep intermittently throughout the day and will prefer a warm, comfortable and safe place. There is a large range of cat beds available, including igloo beds, or hammocks for the radiator. A simple cardboard box with a blanket inside will also do the trick. 

猫平均每天花16小时睡觉。通常会间断进行休息。倾向于舒适，安全，温暖的场所。可以选择的猫窝有很多，比如雪屋式样的猫窝或者是能够挂在暖气上的吊床。仅仅是一个里面放的毯子的纸箱子都可以是很好的猫窝。


Scratching and climbing 抓挠以及攀爬

A scratching post will provide exercise, claw maintenance and a focal point for your cat to express this natural behaviour 
猫抓板能够为猫提供一个锻炼身体，保养指甲以及以及集中注意力以释放天性的对象。

– it will help protect your furniture too. Cats like to stretch and scratch after they wake up, so try placing the scratching post near where they sleep. A good scratching post has the following features: 
- 猫抓板同样也可以保护你的家具。猫习惯在睡醒之后伸展身体，并且抓挠东西，所以你可以试着把猫抓碗放在他们睡觉的地方，一个好的猫抓板应该是这样的：

. a strong sturdy base so the cat can lean against the post without it wobbling 
· 有一个足够坚固的底盘，这样猫能够倚靠在上面不会摇晃。

. tall enough that the cat can stretch fully 
· 足够高，这样猫能够完全的收舒展身体。

. a vertical thread that allows the cat to scratch downwards 
· 有竖直的柱子，这样猫能够向下磨爪。


Eating grass 吃草

A type of grass that cats particularly like is Cocksfoot – it has long broad leaves so it is easy for them to bite. It is believed that eating grass helps cats to cough up hairballs. If your cat can’t go outside, Cocksfoot grass can be grown indoors. Seeds are readily available from garden centres and pet shops. If no grass is provided, your cat may try to eat other household plants which can pose a risk. 

Toileting 排泄

It is a good idea to have one litter tray per cat, plus one extra – especially if your cats are kept indoors. Place the litter trays in different quiet areas of the house, away from the food and water bowls. Cats don’t like using dirty or soiled trays so make sure the litter tray is cleaned at least once a day. This helps to prevent accidents as well as being more hygienic. Cats generally prefer at least 3cm depth of litter and a litter of a sandy texture. Make any changes to the tray, the litter or its location very slowly to avoid accidents. 


Indoors or outdoor access? 到底是否放猫出门？

Overall, the decision on whether to keep the cat inside or allow access outdoors should be assessed on the cat’s personality, health, previous experience, the home and local outside environment and owner’s preferences. Cats kept solely indoors should be provided with ways to exhibit their natural behaviour to ensure their welfare, reduce dependency on owners and avoid undesirable behavioural issues.
