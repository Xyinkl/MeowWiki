Keeping your cat safe 保证猫咪的安全

Cats are naturally inquisitive animals and while most will enjoy happy lives free from danger, their curiosity can get them into scrapes from time to time. As a responsible owner, you’ll want to do all you can to protect against unfortunate incidents. You also have a legal duty of care to provide for your cat’s needs and ensure they are protected from pain, suffering, injury and disease. 

尽管猫咪大多过着平静安详的生活，不过由于天性好奇，它们有时也会陷入险境。作为一个负责任的主人，你应该竭尽所能避免出现不幸的事故。给予你的猫咪生存所需，确保它们不会受疼痛、伤病影响，这也是法律的要求。

Above all, Cats Protection recommends that you:

Cats Protection 建议你至少做到以下几点：

. have your cat neutered – this reduces the risk of your cat fighting and sustaining injury, contracting diseases or become lost 

· 给猫咪绝育，这样会减少你的猫打架受伤、传染疾病以及走失的的风险。

. provide a safe and secure home, with thoughtful placement of their food, water, litter tray, hiding and rest areas. Your cat will need their own space and plenty of enrichment to keep them happy and healthy and encourage them to stay close to home 

·提供一个食物、水源、猫砂盆合理放置，有着藏匿处所以及休息场所的安全舒适的家。你的猫需要自己的空间，而且可能需要更多来保持精神上的愉悦以及身体上的健康，以及对家的眷恋。

. provide a healthy diet and appropriate health care – including vaccination, flea and worming treatment and regular vet check-ups 

· 提供健康的饮食以及适当的健康检查护理（包括疫苗、体内外驱虫以及定期兽医的身体检查）

. ensure your cat is microchipped – so if they go missing, your details can be quickly traced allowing you to be reunited 

· 确保已经给猫植入芯片，这样一旦他们走失，你的资料可以被迅速找到。这样你就可以和猫重新团聚。

. are aware of potential hazards and protect against them where possible 

· 知晓对猫有害的物质并且使其远离猫咪。

. know what to do in case of emergency, or if your cat goes missing 

· 知道紧急情况下或者你的猫走失的情况下如何应对。

. consider taking out pet insurance, to give you peace of mind and the financial means to treat your cat should anything unexpected arise 

· 考虑给你的猫办理宠物保险。这样面对你的猫的任何意外你都能有所准备，无论是思想上还是金钱上。

This guide highlights some of the dangers faced by cats, suggests ways to minimise risk and gives advice on what to do when faced with an emergency. 

以下指导标示了几种猫面对的危险、如何最小化风险以及在危机来临时如何去做。

The dangers at home 家中的威胁

Poisonous substances 有毒物质

Cats are very susceptible to poisoning and a number of everyday household items can pose a danger to them. If you suspect your cat may have eaten a poisonous substance, seek veterinary advice immediately – even if they appear well, delaying for just a few minutes may endanger their life. It is advisable to keep the following chemicals firmly out of your cat’s reach, as anything that gets on your cat’s feet or fur is likely to be ingested when they are grooming: 

猫容易受毒物影响，而且一系列家具用品都能对其造成威胁。如果你怀疑自己的猫使用了有毒物质，请立刻咨询兽医。即便它们暂时没有表现出异样，你耽误的每一分钟都可能危及它们的生命。建议一定不要将以下物质放置在猫可以触及的地方，即便是爪子或者皮毛沾染都会随着猫自我清洁而被吞食。

. antifreeze – is lethal for cats, so always keep this out of your cat’s way and avoid using it in water features. Clear up any antifreeze spills immediately 

· 防冻液对猫是致命的，所以应当使其远离你的猫。如果有溅出的任何防冻液，立刻清理干净。

. disinfectants – particularly those containing phenol, which usually go cloudy when added to water – are very toxic to cats 

· 消毒剂。尤其是含有苯酚的（入水变浑的那种），对猫的毒性很强。

. decorating chemicals, such as white spirit 

· 装修用化学物质，比如石油溶剂。

. pest control agents, such as: 

· 杀虫剂，比如：

. slug bait – is extremely poisonous, especially if it contains metaldehyde or methiocarb 

·蜗牛诱饵对猫极度有害，尤其是含有金属醛或甲氧碳的。

. rodent bait – avoid these, especially anticoagulant types. Even if kept out of the cat’s reach they can still cause harm if the cat eats a poisoned rodent 

· 灭鼠毒饵–避免这些，特别是抗凝血类的。即便不让猫接触，一旦被毒死的啮齿动物被猫食用，也会对猫造成伤害

. weed killers – particularly those containing paraquat 

·除草剂，尤其是含有百草枯的品种。

. insect killers can be extremely toxic to cats 

· 昆虫杀虫剂可能对猫有剧毒。

. dog flea treatment medication 

· 狗驱虫剂

. human medications – even drugs like aspirin and paracetamol can be highly toxic for cats 

· 人类用药品，甚至像阿司匹林和扑热息痛这样的药物对猫也会有很高的毒性。

. certain human foods – including onions, raisins and chocolate 

· 某些人类食物，包括洋葱、葡萄干和巧克力。

. poisonous plants – see over 

· 有毒植物，详见下面



Plants 有毒植物

A number of plants – lilies in particular – can be lethal. Sadly, cats have been poisoned by simply brushing against certain plants and then licking the pollen from their fur. It is advisable to avoid them if at all possible, whether cut flowers or grown in the garden. 

一些植物对猫是致命的，其中百合类占大多数。有的时候，简单的蹭过植物，随后舔食到毛上沾染的花粉都足以让猫中毒。我们的建议是尽最大可能避免猫接触此类植物，无论是插在瓶子里的还是种在花园的。

Plants to avoid include – but are not restricted to: 

应该避免被猫接触的植物包括（但不限于）：

. all types of Lily – Lilium and Hemerocallis species 

· 百合和金合欢属的所有植物

. Lily of the Valley – Convallaria majalis 

· 铃兰

. Foxglove – Digitalis 

· 毛地黄

A comprehensive list of plants that are dangerous to cats can be found on International Cat Care’s website www.icatcare.org. Cats are more likely to chew on plants if they are bored or are looking for grass to nibble, so plant some Cocksfoot grass in the garden or in pots in the home. This is particularly important if your cat doesn’t have access outside. 

在国际猫咪养护（International Cat Care）的网站（www.icatcare.org）上有更为详细的对猫有害的植物列表。猫在无聊或者是需要吃草的时候会撕咬植物，所以你应该在花园或者花盆里种一些鸡脚草。如果你的猫养在室内，这点则尤其重要。

Falls 跌落受伤

Cats can fall from upstairs windows or balconies, so if you want a constant supply of fresh air – particularly if you have a cat which is kept indoors – it is advisable to screen the windows with wire mesh – window screens are commercially available. Avoid giving your cat access to the balcony and make sure it is fenced off. Sadly a number of cats are injured or killed each year after falling from a height. 

猫可能从高处的阳台或者是窗户跌落。如果你的猫养在室内，想给它提供新鲜的空气，那么最好是买纱窗把窗户封起来。将猫和阳台隔开，不要让你的猫进到阳台。很不幸的是，每年都有很多猫因为高出坠落而受伤或者是死亡。

Household appliances 家用电器

Small spaces are attractive to cats and it is natural for them to hide when feeling anxious, or just because they want a peaceful rest. Block off any areas where your cat could become trapped and keep the doors of household appliances such as the washing machine or tumble dryer, firmly shut. Keep your cat away from hot surfaces and liquids. Cats may also be attracted to the water in your toilet, so make sure you leave the lid down to prevent the risk of drowning. 

狭小的地方对猫很有诱惑力，而且当猫受到惊吓会很自然的藏身于狭小空间。有时可能它们只是为了有个安全的休息地点。不要让其能够进入任何可能把它卡住的区域。紧紧关上所有家用电器的门（比如洗衣机、烘干机）。让你的猫远离任何过热的表面以及液体。猫可能会对马桶里的水感兴趣，因此确保每次把马桶盖放下，避免猫咪溺水。

Other indoor hazards 其他室内危害

Screen off open fireplaces and always supervise your cat if you have lit a fire. Take care with electric cables, sewing pins and needles. In particular cats may be attracted to play with the cotton attached to sewing needles which can lead to serious internal injuries. 

把开放式壁炉用纱网封上，如果你生了火，那么要随时监控你的猫。小心电线、缝衣针线。有些猫喜欢玩缝衣针上连着的棉线，这样可能会造成严重的内部损伤。

It’s a good idea to rotate the use of toys to keep games interesting for your cat but don’t leave your cat unattended with toys which could be shredded and eaten or cause entanglement and check toys regularly for signs of wear, replacing when appropriate. Likewise, take care during festivities and avoid leaving your cat unattended with dangling Christmas decorations and tinsel. Don’t let your cat eat party food and make sure they have a safe place to hide and easy access to their food, water and litter tray during parties. Noisy party bangers, Christmas crackers and the general commotion can also be disturbing for your cat, especially if they are used to a quiet household. 

为了让游戏不变的无聊，你可以变换着使用玩具，但是不要让猫单独和玩具在一起。这样可能会似玩具被猫撕碎、被吞食，或者是和猫缠在一起。同样的，在节日期间你也应该注意避免让猫单独面对悬挂着的圣诞装饰。不要让它吃派对上的食物，给它一个安全的地方能够躲藏，并且能够很容易到达食盆、水盆和猫砂盆。喧闹的派对、圣诞的爆竹以及单纯的吵闹也会让你的猫感到不安，尤其是如果它们已经习惯了安静的家庭。


Fireworks and parties 烟火及派对

While firework displays and parties are entertaining for us, they can be distressing for pets. To ensure that your cat will be safe and sound, keep them in after dark and provide them with a litter tray, food and water bowls and a place to hide. During firework season, make sure that all doors and windows are securely closed to prevent your cat from escaping. Try to reduce outside noise by keeping curtains drawn, which will also reduce awareness of any flashes. Playing soothing music or having the TV on may also help. Try not to reinforce fearful behaviour by overly comforting a cat that is looking anxious. A pheromone plug-in diffuser can be used to decrease anxiety and can have a calming effect – start using it a couple of weeks before the fireworks season starts and site it in the room where your cat spends most of their time. 

尽管对于人类来说，烟火表演以及派对是一种娱乐方式。不过这些对猫来说可能是很让其烦躁的。为了保证你的猫安然无事，你需要把它们放在黑暗的角落，给它们猫砂盆、食物和水，让它们有地方可以躲藏。烟火季节，确保所有门窗都是关闭的，以防猫被吓跑。你可以通过拉上窗帘来减少外界的噪音，同时也能减弱外界的闪光。播放舒缓的音乐或者是开着电视可能有点用处。不要过度安慰焦虑的猫，这样可能会强化这种害怕的行为模式。荷尔蒙喷剂可以用来减轻焦虑，安慰猫咪。你可以在烟火季节开始之前的几周开始使用喷剂，并将其喷涂在你的猫经常呆的房间。


Roads 交通隐患

Cats are natural hunters and will tend to be more alert at night time when rodents and other prey are active. Their eyes do not adjust as quickly as ours to changes in light intensity, so sudden bright headlights can be dazzling and disorientating. There is an increased chance of road accidents after nightfall so it is best to keep your cat indoors overnight. Timing meals to coincide with rush hour may also help to keep your cat away from busy roads. 

猫作为天生的猎手，在其猎物活跃的夜晚时分会更加警觉。它们的眼睛不能很快适应光亮的变化，所以突然地光亮照射会造成它们的眩晕不适。

Harnesses 

Some people are worried about letting their cat roam freely outside, so they use a harness with a lead to enable their cat to explore the outdoors safely. While some cats will cope with this – especially if they are used to it from a very early age – others may find it very stressful. Cats are free-roaming creatures and they like to explore their environment at their own pace and choose areas where they feel safe. This ensures they can easily access suitable hiding places if they feel threatened. 

Many cats do not react well to being restrained so the experience may be more negative than not having any outdoor access. If a cat bolts while wearing a harness, it may also be at risk of entrapment. If you choose to use a harness, ensure your cat is introduced to it gradually, and encourage positive associations by using food treats from their daily food ration to reward them. Ensure they are comfortable wearing it inside the house, before you attempt to take them outside. Monitor for signs of stress and let your cat explore at their own pace. Allow them to stay close to the sanctuary of shelter and bushes – rather than forcing them into open spaces. Unlike dogs, cats will not learn to go to the toilet while on a lead and will be unlikely to enjoy being taken for ‘walks’ outside in a place they don’t feel safe. 

Instead of a harness, consider securing the garden with suitable fencing. Alternatively you could make the indoor environment more enriching by varying the scents and objects – such as toys – to enable your cat to exhibit their natural behaviour. Use puzzle feeders and replicate the hunting experience using fishing rod toys. 

Diseases and parasites 

To reduce the risk of infectious diseases, ensure that your cat is fully vaccinated before allowing them outside. Cats adopted from Cats Protection will have already been vaccinated against cat flu which includes feline herpes virus (FHV), feline calicivirus (FCV) and feline parvovirus (FPV) – also known as entertitis. These vaccinations are included as part of our Minimum Veterinary Standards (MVS), but regular booster injections are still needed. Consult your vet to discuss the best protection for your cat. 

Cats can also pick up parasites such as fleas, ticks and a variety of internal worms. Speak to your vet to find out how to prevent and treat these parasites and bear in mind that indoor cats can also suffer. 


Sunburn 

Cats with white fur – including those with white ears or noses – can be susceptible to sunburn during the summer months and sun exposure can be a trigger for a type of cancer. It is certainly a good idea to try to offer some protection – we all know how much cats love to lie in the sun! 

You may consider using a sunscreen to protect your cat’s ears and nose if you can’t restrict your cat’s access to the sun, but we recommend that you discuss this with your vet first. It is very important that product you use is suitable for cats, as they can be sensitive to the chemicals. Cats groom themselves regularly, so the effectiveness of using sunscreens to protect against sunburn or feline skin cancer is unknown. The best way to protect your cat is to try to keep them indoors during the hottest part of the day and to provide shade in your garden – from plants, trees or other objects. 

Ponds 

If you have a pond, cats may be tempted to drink from it. To reduce the risk of them falling in, place some wire mesh securely over the pond, or make sure that there is a low edge so it is easy for a cat to get out. Ensure that any water butts also have a lid on them. 


Sheds, garages and dustbins 

Missing cats often turn out to have been accidentally locked in garden sheds, garages or even bins. Check that a cat hasn’t crept into outbuildings and wheelie bins before closing them. 

Cold weather 

Provide shelter for cats that have access outside. Keep the doors of sheds and outbuildings wedged slightly open – or install a cat flap. If you provide an outdoor water source, check it hasn’t frozen over. Ensure your cat can reach their chosen toileting site and if your cat is seeing snow for the first time, consider giving them access to a safe and enclosed area such as a garden and accompany them when they go out. Keep de-icing products safely out of reach and groom any rock salt residue from your cat’s fur. 

How do I encourage my cat to stay close to home? 

See Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Indoor and outdoor cats for ideas for creating a cat-friendly garden and some fencing tips. 


How do I keep my cat away from hazards in the garden? 

There are a number of humane ways to keeping your cat away from things that cause sickness or injury. Cats dislike the smell of citrus fruit peel and can also be deterred using chicken manure, or pellets of lion dung – this is available from pet shops. 

You can deter cats from certain areas of the garden by using materials that feel uncomfortable under their paws. Suggestions include broken egg shells, stone chippings and prickly plants – ensure that the plants used are not poisonous to cats. If all this fails, clap your hands loudly or try aiming a low-intensity water pistol near your cat when they venture into the forbidden area. 

Indoor only cats 

Certain cats need indoor-only lifestyles. Blind and deaf cats should be kept indoors as they are less aware of oncoming traffic. Cats with Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) should also not be allowed outside – they can spread the virus to other cats and are also at higher risk of catching other diseases. If you adopt from an animal welfare charity like Cats Protection, we will advise you of any known health conditions that cat has and whether they should remain indoors. You may be able to provide some safe outdoor access if you have a secure, escape-proof garden. Cats kept solely indoors will need extra attention paid to ensure their environment is enriching and they can exhibit their natural behaviour. See Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Indoor and outdoor cats. 


What do I do if my cat gets lost? 

At Cats Protection we understand how traumatic it can be when a much-loved pet suddenly goes missing. Follow this advice to aid your chances of finding them safe and well. 

Look 

Cats are well known for their curiosity and ability to find unlikely sleeping places, so check the following places at home while calling your cat and ask your neighbours to do the same: 

. all rooms 

. cupboards 

. boxes and underneath beds 

. household appliances like washing machines 

. sheds and garages 

. vehicles 

. gardens 

. hedgerows – watch out for snares 

. lost and found sections in local newspapers 

Advertise 

Create some flyers with a clear description of your cat – a photo is a big help: 

. put posters on trees – available from your local Cats Protection branch 

. distribute flyers to local shops, garages and Post Offices 

. contact local schools, newspapers and even radio 

. the internet and social media sites can be a great tool to help track down a lost animal 

Inform 

You can also let individuals and organisations know – don’t underestimate the power of word-of-mouth communication. Contact: 

. neighbours 

. local veterinary surgeons 

. your cat’s microchip database provider – ensure all your contact details are up to date 

. local schools – children are particularly observant when it comes to animals 

. local Cats Protection branch – 03000 12 12 12 

. register them as missing with www.animalsearchuk.co.uk . other local animal charities 

. the environmental health department of your local council 

. delivery people – post, newspaper, milk etc 

. some companies offer commercial help and support in tracking lost pets 

Above all, don’t give up hope – we hear so many tales of cats being found and reunited with their owners, sometimes years after they have gone missing. If you succeed in finding your cat: 

. inform any people or authorities who have been asked to look for them 

. ensure they are microchipped in case they stray again and always keep your contact details up to date with the microchip database 

Emergencies 
What is an emergency? 
Cats hide pain very well and sometimes only show subtle signs of disease. However, it is generally more straightforward to recognise when a cat requires urgent emergency treatment. You may suspect or have witnessed a traumatic incident, or the cat may be showing obvious signs. In an emergency, your first point of contact should be your veterinary practice – make sure you keep their details in a handy place. Signs that a cat requires emergency advice and/or treatment include: 
. trauma eg road traffic accidents, dog attacks and falls 

. collapse 

. frequent vomiting and/or profuse or bloody diarrhoea 

. difficulty breathing, such as open-mouth breathing or marked effort to breathe 

. continual/repeated straining to pass urine 

. dehydration – assess by pinching a fold of skin. If it does not recoil immediately, the cat may require fluid therapy 

. any form of fit or convulsion 

. severe discharge from eyes, particularly if in combination with a thick nasal discharge 

. severe lameness 

. severe salivation/dribbling 

. a high temperature – signs include the cat being unwilling to move or feeling hot to touch, especially on the ears. The third eyelid may also be showing 

. signs of shock – pale lips, gums and eyes, a rapid heart rate and quick shallow breathing, cold extremities, lethargy, weakness and collapse 

. difficulties when a female cat is giving birth – for more information, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Pregnancy, birth and caring for young kittens 

This list is by no means exhaustive so if you are in doubt, seek veterinary advice. It is also advisable to contact your vet if your cat’s routine habits or behaviour changes, as well as when more obvious signs of disease are apparent, such as coughing and sneezing, vomiting and diarrhoea or lameness. Even subtle signs such as reduced activity, changes in vocalisation or an increased appetite or thirst can indicate underlying disease. Your vet will be able to advise on whether urgent treatment is needed. 

First aid 

The initial steps taken following an accident, illness or injury are known as first aid – it aims to: 

. preserve life 

. prevent suffering 

. prevent a condition from getting worse 

First aid does not mean making a diagnosis or giving any medication, but it can help to promote a good recovery. Where possible, expert help should be called immediately as attempting first aid can delay necessary veterinary treatment, compromising welfare. Cats may require oxygen therapy and specialist care and delays can cost lives. 

All veterinary practices are required to make provision for 24 hour emergency care – either via their own surgery or with an alternative practice in the area. Ring the vets to find out what to do. They can give you advice, let you know where to go should emergency treatment be required and prepare for the cat’s arrival. 

Try to remain calm, as stress will affect your ability to help – you are more likely to do something wrong if you panic and it may worsen any stress of the cat. Take a deep breath and assess the situation – remember to consider the dangers to you as well as the cat. If the cat needs to be moved from where it is, find a suitable place to administer first aid nearby. 

Remember that the most serious and most life threatening injury will need attention first. This may not be the injury that looks the most dramatic – for example a bleeding wound or broken leg may not be the worst injury, there may be other more serious internal injuries. 

Wear protective clothing if available – distressed cats often scratch and bite. Avoid direct eye contact with the cat as it will find this threatening and use slow, deliberate movements and a calm soothing voice. Don’t ‘shush’ as you might with a person, this can sound much like another cat hissing and can make the cat more distressed. 

The cat may be frightened and in pain, so take extra care when moving them. Putting a towel over the cat before lifting them can help to calm them. Use one hand in front of their front legs or under the lower side shoulder if the cat is on its side. Place the other hand behind or under the back legs and move the cat quickly and quietly onto a board or tray, blanket or into a box. Be very careful, not to disturb their position and avoid touching any obvious injuries. Try to ensure they are contained in a carrier if taking them to the vets, in case they suddenly try to escape. 

Shock 

A cat suffering with shock requires immediate veterinary attention. Shock can occur as a consequence of any disease, injury or emergency and can be fatal in its own right. It may not occur until several hours after a trauma and can make what was a minor emergency into a life-threatening one. Signs include pale lips, gums and eyes, a rapid heart rate and quick shallow breathing, cold extremities, lethargy, weakness and collapse. Seek veterinary advice immediately. Use a towel or blanket to preserve body heat if this does not distress the cat and keep them comfortable. Do not attempt to feed or give water. 

Bleeding

Both internal and external bleeding can be dangerous so seek veterinary help immediately. Pressure should be applied to an open wound using a clean towel. If the blood soaks through the dressing, apply another on top. Do not attempt to remove any foreign bodies such as debris or nails as severe bleeding may occur. Avoid attempting to apply tourniquets as these can result in permanent damage and possible amputation. 

Fits, seizures and convulsions 

Fits or seizures can result from epilepsy, poisoning, organ failure or a lesion in the brain. Fits will vary in duration and frequency. Signs of fitting include changes in behaviour, drooling, rigidity or paddling and muscle tremors and/or loss of bladder control. The cat may lose consciousness or collapse. If you see this happening, remain calm and keep the room dark and quiet. Avoid holding the cat and remove any potentially harmful objects from the area. Observe closely, noting the duration and frequency of seizures and call the vet immediately. 

Poisoning 

Routes of poisoning include ingestion, absorption through the skin and by licking substances off the coat. As there are so many different types of poison, there are also a number of different signs that a cat may show after exposure to a toxic substance. These can include salivation, vomiting and diarrhoea, twitching and fitting. Your cat may have breathing difficulties, show signs of shock or collapse and go into a coma. These signs tend to appear suddenly so if you suspect that your cat may have ingested a poisonous substance, you must act quickly. If you can see the poison, then take your cat away from it immediately and phone your vet for advice in the first instance. You may need to take your cat straight down to the surgery. Inducing vomiting in your cat may not be the best course of action. Look for evidence of what your cat may have eaten and make sure you take it with you to the vet. Even a sample of vomit may help diagnosis, particularly if it is an unusual colour or contains plant matter. If you are suspicious your cat may have been deliberately poisoned, speak with your vet and contact the RSPCA 24 hour action line 0300 1234 199. For more information, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Cats and the law. 

Medicines 

Do not use human medicines or creams without seeking 
veterinary advice – many are not safe for cats. 
For further advice on veterinary care, see our Essential Guides: 
Caring for your cat and Pregnant cats, birth and care of young 
kittens and the Veterinary Guide: You and your vet. 

Cats are free roaming and inquisitive animals, but they are usually careful to keep themselves out of danger. However, it can be helpful to know the hazards to avoid and action to take in the face of an emergency, to keep your cat happy and safe.
