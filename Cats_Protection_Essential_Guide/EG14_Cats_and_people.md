Cats and people 猫咪和人类


If you already share your life with a cat, you’re probably aware that you get far more than just companionship and affection in return, but did you know that owning a cat has proven health and social benefits? 

如果你已经在养一只猫了，那你可能已经了解到了养猫能够得到陪伴和情感上的回馈。但是你是否知道，拥有一只猫也能够对你的身体健康以及社交产生促进呢？

Cat owners are less likely to suffer from stress and are known to relax more and have greater life satisfaction. Cats keep their owners feeling young and active and learning how to care for a cat can do wonders for a child’s self-esteem, social skills and sense of responsibility to others. For many owners, their cat is an integral member of the family – inspiring feelings of peace, joy and happiness and providing fun and laughter. The emotional bond between human and pet can be as rewarding as many human relationships and may offer similar psychological benefits. Cats can make a house a home. 

养猫的人更不容易受到焦虑的困扰，而且更倾向于休闲，对人生的满意度更高。猫能够让主人感觉年轻、有激情。学习如何关爱一只猫能够帮助形成孩子的自尊心形成、社交技巧以及对他人的责任感。对于很多主人来说，他们的猫已然是家庭的一份子了，能够为家庭提供安详平和、欢声笑语的气氛。在猫和人之间形成的情感联系像人与人之间的关系一样，能够提供心理学上的促进。猫让一个家更像家。

Domestication 驯化

The earliest evidence of cats living with man comes from a 9500 year old grave found in Cyprus. A human and a cat were found buried together – thought to be ‘early evidence for the taming of cats.’ Before this grave was discovered, tombs containing mummified cats and depictions in art from ancient Egypt – around 2000 BC – were the earliest proof we had of cats living alongside people. 

猫最早被证明和人生活在一起的证据是在塞浦路斯的一个有9500年历史的坟墓。一个人和一只猫被葬在一起，这也被认为是猫被驯化最早期的证据。在此之前，最早能够证明猫和人生活在一起的是，公元前2000年左右的古埃及绘画以及装有被制作成木乃伊的猫的坟墓。

Domestication of cats probably began in the Middle East. A change in farming activities meant that quantities of grain were stored near human settlements. Rodents fed on the grain, attracting wildcats which found them an easy source of food. Humans grew to value these cats for protecting their grain stores from vermin and probably encouraged this mutually beneficial relationship to some degree. As cats became more esteemed – even idolised as gods – man looked after them and in some cases, controlled their breeding. This has resulted in the domestic cat species found throughout the world today. However, the term domestication relates to a species where all the breeding and care has been controlled by people and this is not strictly the case for cats. 

对猫的驯化可能起源于中东。种植活动的变迁使得大量的谷物被存放在人类住处附近。而鼠类吃谷物，这会把野猫吸引过来。因为野猫能够保护谷物不被害虫所侵蚀，这也在一定程度上促进了这种双方共赢关系的建立。猫逐渐被人更为尊重甚至是被神化，于是人类开始照顾他们，并且在有些时候会控制他们的繁衍。这就导致了世界各地现在普遍存在的家猫的物种产生。不过“驯化”意味着整个种族的繁衍都被人类控制，这一点在猫上并不严格适用。

These days, in spite of ‘domestication,’ all cats need to have positive and friendly experiences with humans from a young age in order to feel safe around people. Between the ages of two to eight weeks of age, the brains of kittens are developing 
– it is a key time in their life known as the socialisation period when they are able to be socialised with people. If they are handled and gently cared for by a variety of people during this crucial time, they will usually grow up to be friendly pets. Without this early learning experience, kittens will become wild – feral cats – and remain fearful of people throughout their life. 

时至今日，无论“驯化”与否，所有的猫都需要在早期和人类有正向、友善的接触经历，这样才能安然待在人类附近。在幼猫2至8周的时候，其脑补正在发育，这也是被叫做“社交发展阶段”的关键时期，在这段时期幼猫能够人类正常互动。如果在这个阶段幼猫能够被不同的人轻柔友善的对待，那么长大后通常都会是很友善的宠物。如果没有这段体验，幼猫则会长大变成野猫，终身保持对人类的恐惧。

Feral cats are usually the offspring of abandoned cats, or those already living wild. They make great mousers so are often found living as farm cats, but they also live in towns and cities. Feral cats can survive in the wild with little or no human intervention. Obviously, they are still able to breed with our pet cats, which is one of the reasons why neutering is so important. For further information, see the Cats Protection Essential Guide: Feral cats. 

野猫通常都是野猫或者是被人遗弃的猫的后代。它们是猎鼠能手，所以经常会作为农场猫出现。不过，有的野猫也会在城镇和城市中生存。野猫在野外中极少或不依靠人类干预而生存。而且它们能够和家中的宠物猫交配。这也是需要给猫做绝育的很重要的原因。了解更多，请参阅猫咪保护基础指导之野猫篇。

Cats in modern society 现代社会中的猫

Cats continue to benefit people in a wide range of ways – providing eco-friendly vermin control on farms and stables, companionship in family homes or cheering up the residents in a care home. Living with a feline friend brings many benefits and it also places legal responsibilities on the owner. Much of the law in relation to animals has now been consolidated into the Animal Welfare Act 2006 – England and Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland have equivalent legislation – the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and the Welfare of Animals Act (Northern Ireland) 2011. The Act applies to both domestic and feral cats and in addition to cruelty offences, it places a duty of care on owners and those responsible for looking after cats to ensure that their welfare needs are met. These emphasise the need: 

猫仍然以多种形式造福人类：比如在农场和牛棚提供一种无害环境的害虫控制，比如在家中陪伴人类，以及在养老院给老人带来温暖。和猫生活在一起有诸多好处，但是主人同时也要尽到法定的义务。很多与动物保护相关的法律都已经被整合进了2006年英格兰和威尔士的动物福利法案。苏格兰和北爱尔兰也有类似的法案：苏格兰2006动物健康和福利法案以及北爱尔兰2011动物福利法案。这些法案适用于所有猫（无论是野猫还是家猫），对于可能存在的虐待动物行径，法案要求动物主人或者负有管控责任的个人应当确保猫的以下生活需求得到保障：

. for a suitable environment (place to live) 
· 有一个舒适的生存环境

. for a suitable diet 
· 有适宜的饮食来源

. to exhibit normal behaviour patterns 
· 能够自由施展天性

. to be housed with, or apart from, other animals 
· 和其他动物同居一室，或者是远离一些其他动物

. to be protected from pain, suffering, injury and disease 
· 不受到伤痛，疾病的折磨。

Sadly, cats sometimes become the innocent victims of people 
遗憾的是，猫有的时候会成为人们之间无辜的受害者。

 through ignorance or neglect, or due to intentional cruelty and over breeding – so it is important to understand what they need to ensure their physical and emotional welfare. Pets can sometimes become targets for abuse in households affected by domestic violence, so Cats Protection is involved in an initiative called the Freedom Project in collaboration with Dogs Trust to protect cats and dogs in danger. For more information on an owner’s duty of care and cruelty, see Cats Protection Essential Guide: Cats and the law. 

无论是不管不顾还是有意虐待，或者是过度繁衍，主人对于猫的生理、心理需求应该有所了解。宠物有的时候会成为家庭暴力的出气筒，所以猫咪保护致力于Freedom Project的项目，联合Dogs Trust对处在危险之中的猫和狗进行营救。需要关于主人的责任以及虐待动物相关信息，请参阅猫咪保护基础指导之猫和法律篇。

It is important that owners provide the right care and resources to meet their pet’s biological and emotional needs, as well as neutering their cat before it can breed. It is very important to neuter your cat – there are already thousands of unwanted cats and kittens and not enough homes for them. A large cat population also has a negative impact on our current pets. Cats often live in close proximity in neighbouring homes–this reduces their territory size, causing conflict as each cat defends their patch. Discord can also occur between cats in the same household if they are forced to share territories and they can’t get along. The fashion for minimalist home interiors and gardens also means there are fewer refuges for cats to retreat to. Feline infectious diseases are also more efficiently spread when cats are densely populated. Cats are rapid breeders and the number of kittens they produce increases with ample food and shelter, so the population of our loved pets can quickly get out of control if they aren’t neutered. 

对于主人来说，基于宠物的生理心理需求给予正确的护理以及照顾是很有必要的，比如在猫能够生育之前就为其进行绝育。现在已经有成千上万的流浪猫没有家庭能够安置。太多猫同样对家中的宠物猫也是危害。流浪猫大多生活在临近的社区。这会减少彼此的领地范围，为了维护自己的领地而造成冲突。如果几只猫被迫待在同一个地方还不能友善相处，那很可能会出现不合的情况。极简风格的家装以及花园造成了猫能够躲藏的地方越来越少。猫之间的传染病在多猫环境下更容易传播。食物、水源充足的条件下，猫繁殖很快。所以如果不给我们心爱的宠物做绝育手术，那可能很快家里猫的数量就会失控。

Neutering not only helps with population control but it also brings many benefits to the individual cat, particularly if performed before sexual maturity is reached. This includes health benefits eg a reduction or prevention of certain cancers and behavioural benefits – neutered cats are less likely to roam, fight or spray. For more information on the benefits of neutering see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Neutering – family planning for felines. 

绝育不光有助于猫的数量控制，也能够对猫个体有好的作用，尤其是在猫性成熟之前就进行绝育的。比如绝育能够减少或者避免某些种类的癌症的发生，形成不容易狂奔、打架、喷尿的温顺性格。需要更多关于绝育的信息，请参照猫咪保护基础指导之绝育篇


Cats and children 猫和孩子

Growing up with a pet can be an extremely rewarding experience for any youngster. Many children regard their cat as their best friend and it is through this friendship that important lessons are learned – in trust and empathy, care and love – which help children become responsible and caring adults. For an only child, their cat may provide a vital source of friendship and opportunity for play – children often prefer to share their feelings with a pet rather than another person. There are many physical benefits for children too and pet ownership can provide a source of comfort during recovery and rehabilitation. A number of studies in the UK and USA report that exposure to pets during infancy may significantly reduce the risk for asthma and allergies in later childhood. Primary school children from pet-owning households are also shown to have lower sickness absenteeism from school. 

和猫一起成长对任何一个孩子来说都是绝佳的经历。很多孩子都把猫当做是他们最好的朋友，并从这段友谊中受益良多。信任、同情、关爱、呵护，这些都能够让孩子更加有责任感，对成年人更加关心。对独生子女，猫能给予孩子的友谊，也是绝佳的玩伴。孩子可能更倾向于跟宠物而非成年人去分享自己的感受。而且养宠物对于处在恢复适应期的孩子也能提供一定的慰藉。英国和美国的一些研究表明，幼年时期接触过宠物能够极大程度的降低后来发生哮喘以及过敏的危险。来自有养宠物家庭的小学生的病假率相对也较低。

Learning by experience 经历、学习

From their earliest days, children can be taught to be gentle and kind with cats. Children learn best by example – if you treat your cat gently with love and respect, it’s more likely your children will grow up to do the same. 

一开始，孩子们会被教导对猫轻柔、友善。孩子们则会根据你的行为做出模仿，如果你对猫轻柔友善，那么孩子也会效仿。

As soon as your children can understand, explain that cats like to be left alone when sleeping or eating and that they can become frightened when people shout, make sudden movements or try to grab them. Children soon learn to interpret the signs of an unhappy cat – the swishing tail, ruffled-up fur or hissing – and will avoid doing things that upset them. Your children will love helping to take care of your cat too, so involve them in the feeding, grooming and playing routines and you’ll have happy children and a content cat! 

逐渐，孩子们会理解，最好不要在猫吃饭和睡觉的时候打扰它，如果大声吵闹或者是突然袭击试图抓住它，是会让猫受到惊吓的。孩子们会理解猫状态不好时的状态，比如摆动尾巴、炸毛或者是嘶叫，进而避免做出可能惊扰到猫的行为。你的孩子也会喜欢照顾猫，所以可以让他帮忙给猫喂食、梳毛，陪猫玩耍。这样你会拥有一个高兴的孩子，也会有一只惬意的猫。

Cats feel safer if they can watch events taking place from an accessible high vantage point. Provide your cat with a high window sill, cupboard top or add some cat shelves. This will mean they can still be involved in family life but out of the hectic hullabaloo going on below! Teach children not to disturb the cat while they are in their safe place, or while they are sleeping, eating or using the litter tray. 

猫如果能够在高处观察所有事情，会更有安全感。你可以给猫准备一个高的窗台、碗柜或者是猫爬架。这样就能让猫既不被下面家庭生活的喧闹打扰，又能够静静地参与其中。你需要教导孩子不要在猫处在它们认为安全的地方时打扰它，也不要在猫吃饭睡觉或者是上厕所的时候打扰它。

Food or litter trays should be moved out of the reach of toddlers, but put some thought into the new locations. Ensure they are still located in a place suitable for the cat, to avoid any stress or toileting accidents. See Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Feline behaviour for more information. 

食物和猫砂盆应该放在孩子不能接触到的地方，放置的场所应该谨慎考虑。确保这些东西的位置让猫感到适合，不会引起焦虑或者是排泄问题。具体参见猫咪保护基础指导之猫科动物行为篇。

Cats and babies 猫和婴儿

Most cats will get on famously with a new arrival in the household but a baby does bring a whole change of routine and lifestyle for your cat. The character of your cat – whether shy or confident – will affect how they react to this new experience. It’s important to remember that even though you have a new baby and all the sleepless nights to contend with, you still have a responsibility to keep your cat healthy and happy. Your cat will have been used to having your undivided attention before the birth and the sudden change in priorities can be unsettling for them. 

大多数猫对家中的新成员都会很热诚，但是婴儿确实会给猫的的日常生活习惯带来很大的影响。猫的性格（内向或者开朗）会决定它们如何对待婴儿。需要注意的是，尽管你有了新的婴儿，也需要面对无数个无眠的夜晚，你仍然有保持猫健康快乐的义务和责任。你的猫习惯了拥有你所有的注意力，而在婴儿降生后，可能会让其感到不适。

Following the tips outlined in this leaflet can help ensure everyone in the household is happy and contented. 

遵循以下建议能够帮助家庭中的每一份子都保持高兴愉悦。

A growing family 扩张的家庭

It’s always best to be prepared, so once you know you are pregnant: 

凡事预则立，所以一旦你发现自己怀孕了：

. make sure your cat is in good health by taking them for a check-up at the vet 

· 带猫去做个体检，确保它的身体健康。

. if your cat is not neutered, get this done without delay 

· 如果你的猫还没有绝育，那么不要拖延，立刻去做。

. introduce your cat to any baby items you buy, such as nursery furniture or prams – let your cat investigate but don’t let them climb on them and then keep them shut away. It is important to ensure the items are off limits because some will be very tempting places for your cat to sleep 

· 让你的猫接触你买的婴儿用品，比如婴儿床或者是婴儿车。让猫能够有所了解，但是不要让猫能够攀爬，并且之后隔离猫和婴儿用品。保证这些物品成为猫的禁区很重要，因为这些区域很可能对猫是很有诱惑力的睡觉场所。

. begin getting your cat used to the sounds of the baby. Record a friend or relative’s baby or buy a CD that you can play on a very low volume to begin with and gradually increase the noise. Crying can be worrying for a cat that hasn’t heard it before 

· 开始让你的猫习惯婴儿的声音。你可以录下朋友或者是亲戚家孩子的哭声或者是买相关的CD，一开始用很低的音量播放，随后逐渐增大音量。听到之前很少听到的哭声对于猫来说可能会引发焦虑。

. consult your doctor or health visitor about any other steps that you need to take 

· 其他可行的措施，你可以咨询医生或者是健康顾问。


A safe pregnancy 安全备孕

Sadly, some mums-to-be consider giving up their cats over fears of toxoplasmosis, a micro-organism that can affect the foetus if a pregnant women is infected. 

遗憾的是，有些准妈妈会出于对弓形虫的恐惧放弃她们养的猫。如果孕妇感染了弓形虫，这种微生物可能会影响胎儿发育。

However, a major study in the British Medical Journal concluded that contact with cats was not a risk factor for toxoplasma infection, despite many believing this to be so. Although cats are a link in the transmission of toxoplasmosis, the main sources of infection to people are through contact with contaminated soil – from gardening without gloves or eating unwashed fruit or vegetables – or by eating undercooked meat. 

然而，与很多人的认识相悖，在英国医学日报上的研究表明，和猫的接触并不是感染弓形虫的风险点。尽管猫确实是弓形虫传播的媒介，但其感染的源头主要是人解除了被污染的土壤，无论是不戴手套进行园艺劳作还是吃了没有清洗过的水果蔬菜，或者是吃了没有完全熟透的肉类。

It is best to wear gloves and an apron when dealing with your cat’s litter tray – better still, it’s the perfect excuse to get someone else to do it! If you are worried about owning a cat while pregnant, seek advice from your doctor and see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Cats and pregnant women – Toxoplasmosis. 

在接触猫砂盆的时候最好是戴上手套以及围裙。更好的消息是，这无疑是让家中某些人铲屎的绝佳借口！如果你在担忧怀孕期间养猫的风险，那么可以咨询一下医生或者是参阅猫咪保护医学指导之猫和孕妇篇。

New routines 新的生活习惯

Cats are creatures of habit and thrive on routine. Introducing a new routine gradually for your cat before the baby arrives will help ease the situation when the big day comes. Begin by: 

猫是按习惯规律作息的生物。在婴儿降生前，你需要提前让猫适应新的作息规律，这样当那一天到来的时候，猫就会更好适应一点。

. putting the nursery room strictly out of bounds – this is particularly important if your cat has previously had free rein in the house 

· 禁止猫进入婴儿房，这点对于之前能够自由进出每个屋子的猫尤其重要。

. reducing the amount of ‘lap time’ your cat gets – you won’t have time to give your cat as much attention once the baby arrives 

· 减少和你的猫腻在一起的时间，因为在婴儿出生后，你可能不会有那么多时间分配给猫。

. If you need to move your cat’s feeding or toileting place, do it gradually so it will not upset your cat’s routine too much 

· 如果你需要调整猫的进食、如厕场所，务必缓慢进行，这样不会让猫的规律作息受到太大影响。


Once baby arrives 

It is never too early for children to learn to respect, love and understand animals and it’s important they feel confident around them. It’s the basis of true companionship. Your baby will be around three months old before he or she first notices that there is something not human in the house. Your cat will have noticed the baby from day one and may be curious about the new arrival, so don’t panic if your cat sniffs the baby’s feet or hangs around the pram like a guard-cat. Not all cats are baby lovers, many will just ignore the new infant and keep a wide berth. 

Do: 
. use a safe cot or pram net to keep the cat at bay – pull it taut to deter your cat from using it as a bed 

. keep the nursery inaccessible to your cat while the baby is asleep and make sure any open windows are cat proof 

. keep all of the baby’s feeding utensils out of the cat’s reach 

. keep the baby and cat food separately, you don’t want to get them mixed up in a sleep-deprived moment! 

. try and set aside a part of the day to make a fuss of your cat as it’s important that their normal routines are maintained – it will give you a chance to grab a quiet moment and relax 

. remember your cat should be regularly treated for fleas and worms and their litter tray kept clean 



And don’t: 
. leave a baby and a cat together unsupervised, even if you trust your cat 100 per cent 

. leave any children’s sandboxes uncovered in case a cat is tempted to use it as a litter tray 


If you have concerns about your cat’s behaviour once the baby has arrived, please seek advice from a qualified cat behaviourist who may easily be able to pinpoint a trigger factor and help you to get back to the harmony you previously enjoyed. 


Cats and the elderly 

Cats can be an enormous source of comfort for older people, providing some structure for each day, and a sense of purpose. Feline companions provide friendship, affection and social support. Stroking a cat has been shown to reduce blood pressure and older people with a pet have also been found to be more attentive to their own care needs and have an improved sense of their own well-being. The benefits cats can bring the elderly are frequently recognised by day centres and residential care homes, some of which now allow occupants to bring in their own cat or have a resident cat. 

Cats and health 

There is an increasing body of evidence that shows cats can be beneficial to physical and mental health. Many cat owners derive comfort and a renewed sense of well-being by stroking and grooming their cat. Such activities can improve people’s mood, reducing levels of stress hormones and increasing the levels of a variety of feel-good hormones – as well as bringing great enjoyment for the cat. Many people can benefit from interaction with cats – especially those affected by a mental and physical health issues. Cats can be therapeutic for those with depression, dementia or autism. Stroking a feline friend can help reduce high blood pressure and improve the recovery of trauma victims. Caring for pets can also be helpful as part of the rehabilitation of offenders. 

Bereavement 

The bond owners share with their cat is similar to that found in human relationships – people often relate to their cats as family members. Understandably, grief reactions are natural following feline bereavement. The sadness felt following the demise of a cat as well as the loss of companionship, emotional support and motivation can leave bereaved cat owners feeling isolated and alone. All individuals react differently and bereavement support is available. For more advice on coping with bereavement, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: When to let go. 

Working with cats 

There are many opportunities to spend more time with cats, beyond enjoying them as pets in your home. Vets practices, pet-sitters, animal welfare organisations and boarding catteries welcome feline enthusiasts, who find helping cats in need extremely rewarding. For more opportunities for volunteering or working with Cats Protection, see our website, www.cats.org.uk 

Keeping safe 

As with all things in life, interaction with animals is not absolutely risk-free, but it is important to balance the positive influence cats can have in people’s lives with any potential risks. Being fully informed can help cat owners minimise the risks. 

Bites and scratches 

Taking some time to understand 

a cat’s behaviour and motivations and providing appropriate resources for them, all go a long way to help avoiding feline aggression. See Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Managing you cat’s behaviour for more information and seek appropriate behavioural advice early on if you have concerns about your cat. Cats can bite or scratch on occasion due to a variety of health or behavioural reasons. It also is a normal defence reaction if they are feeling threatened, or are in pain. If you are scratched or bitten, it is important to act promptly. 

All animals carry micro-organisms such as bacteria in their mouths and on their skin and nails. Bites and scratches can lead to infection with those micro-organisms, some of which can cause more harm than others. Early medical treatment is usually required to prevent the debilitating effects of such injuries, particularly in those people with weakened immune systems. 

Shared infections 

You will be well aware of the many infections that are shared between people, such as colds and flu. Cats can also suffer with infections which can be passed to other felines. There are also some infections which can pass between animals and people, known as zoonoses. Some zoonoses can pass from cat to person – including those transmitted through bites and scratches – as well as from person to cat. The risk of catching a zoonotic disease from a cat is very small. Using common sense together with a good hygiene routine will significantly reduce the risk, for example: 

. provision of appropriate toileting areas and careful hygiene with litter trays 

. feed a good quality, complete diet designed for cats 

. routinely treat your cats for fleas, roundworms and tapeworms 
. keep your cat’s vaccinations up to date 

. seek veterinary advice if your cat is unwell 

. avoid situations which could lead to bites and scratches and if they occur, seek medical advice 


Some examples of feline zoonotic diseases include ringworm, salmonella and flea infestation. If your cat is diagnosed with a zoonotic infection then your vet will alert you to the risks and advise you on how to care for the animal and prevent the spread to humans. 

Infections are more commonly shared between people, than between people and cats. However, it is recommended that immuno-compromised people – such as organ transplant recipients, those having chemotherapy for cancer and AIDS patients – seek medical advice, particularly if considering close contact with an immuno-compromised cat – such as those infected with FIV or other chronic diseases. 

For further information on ringworm and fleas please see our Veterinary Guides: Itchy cats and skin disorders and Fleas and other parasites, or see the Cat Group policy statement on zoonoses at www.thecatgroup.org.uk 


Cats and allergies 

Things that cause allergic reactions are called triggers or allergens. Almost anything can be an allergen including pollen, dust mites or tobacco smoke. Detergents and perfumes can also cause an allergic reaction, as can insect stings, pet hair and feathers. 

The severity of an allergic reaction varies dramatically from person to person. Symptoms include: 
. sneezing and a runny or blocked nose 

. itchy and watery eyes 

. coughing and wheezing 

. itchy skin 


Asthma and eczema sufferers may find that their symptoms are exacerbated by the presence of an allergen. 

Am I allergic to cats? 

It is fairly obvious that some people are allergic to cats because they have an almost immediate reaction to a cat entering a room. In other cases it may not be so easy to tell, particularly if someone is allergic to more than one trigger in their environment. 

If you think you or a family member might be allergic to your cat, it is a good idea to have a trial separation to determine if the cat is the cause of the reaction. Cats are often singled out because they are easily identifiable, but it is important to remember that they are just one possible cause and that dust mites are by far the most common trigger for household allergies. 

If you don’t own a cat but are thinking of getting one, a visit to someone who has a cat or to an adoption centre may indicate whether you are allergic or not – although some people may react to some cats and not others. If you are suspicious that you are allergic, it may be a good idea to speak with your doctor first. 


Is there anything I can do to ease my symptoms? 

Most importantly, speak with your doctor first. It may be helpful to discuss the following actions that can significantly ease allergy symptoms for sufferers: 

. using antihistamine tablets or nasal spray – please consult your doctor first 

. having hardwood floors instead of carpets and using blinds instead of curtains 

. avoiding woollen clothing 

. designating some areas as cat-free zones, particularly bedrooms 

. open the windows for at least one hour every day and move the litter tray and cat bed away from air vents 

. regularly cleaning rooms where the cat sleeps – vacuumed rooms should be allowed to settle as vacuuming stirs up allergens. Air filters may also help 

. fitting plastic covers over cushions and mattresses 

. grooming your cat outdoors on a daily basis and wiping them with a damp cloth 

. washing your cat’s bed regularly 


In tests, Bio-life Petal Cleanse alleviated the symptoms of 90 per cent of sufferers. For more information on Petal Cleanse and many other products endorsed by Allergy UK, visit their website www.allergyuk.org or phone their helpline 01322 619 898. 

Breeds of cat 

Certain breeds or even different moggies are better for allergy sufferers than others – trial and error is the only way to tell if this is the case for you. 

Cats Protection does not support the creation of hypoallergenic cats – the money spent on just one of these genetically engineered cats could help so many other felines in need. 

Can I get a cat if I am allergic? 

If you still want a cat even though you have a reaction to them, then your symptoms are probably mild to moderate and therefore manageable via the steps above. Some people find that repeated exposure to the same cat banishes their allergic reaction altogether. 

Should I keep my cat? 

The answer to this varies greatly from person to person. First you must make sure that it is the cat causing the allergic reaction; you don’t want to go through the stress and upset of rehoming a much-loved pet only to discover that stress is what brings on your asthmatic attacks! 

In the end, the decision about whether to get or keep a cat depends entirely on you and the severity of your reaction. In some cases the symptom-easing steps above may provide enough relief for you to live happily with a cat, but in others it is advisable to avoid cats and seek advice from your doctor. For further details on this, please see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Caring for your cat. 


Make your house a home 

Cats are popular pets and can be great stress-busters for families and people living alone or house sharing. They can provide companionship, emotional support and motivation for young and old – as well as opportunities for play and nurture. 
It is very rewarding to provide for your cat’s needs, learn more about their behaviour and ensure you have a mutually beneficial relationship. Cats Protection has thousands of cats in care across our UK network of branches and adoption centres. Consider adopting a cat and make your house a home. You can get contact details for your nearest branch by phoning our national Helpline 03000 12 12 12 or via our website www.cats.org.uk
