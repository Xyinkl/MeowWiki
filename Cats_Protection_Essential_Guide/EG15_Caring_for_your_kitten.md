Caring for your kitten 关爱幼猫

Kittens are adorable, fun and unique, but it is important to remember that providing a home for a kitten is a commitment for its lifetime, which may be 15 to 20 years. Before you take on a new kitten, there are a few things to consider. Kittens are very mischievous, full of energy and often time consuming. If you are particularly keen to protect your curtains, sofa or other furniture, then you may like to consider adopting an adult or older cat.

幼猫很萌，也有趣而独特。但是你需要注意的是，把小猫领回家意味着对它的一生要负起责任，这责任通常会是15到20年。在你领养一只新的幼猫之前，需要考虑几件事。小猫很调皮、精力充沛，很耗费你的时间。如果很爱护你的窗帘、沙发或者是其他家具，那领养一只成年猫或者是老年猫可能是你更好的选择。

There are responsibilities involved in owning any cat and if you are thinking about adopting a kitten, we would recommend you first read Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Caring for your cat. Your new kitten will be a cat before you know it and you will need to understand how to look after their welfare throughout their life. However, there are also some additional considerations for kittens which this guide highlights. Although they do not stay young for long, the care you provide for your kitten will help ensure their happiness and set the path for you both to enjoy a lasting companionship. 

收养任何一只猫都意味着责任。如果你想收养一只小猫，我们建议你首先阅读猫咪保护基础指导之关爱你的猫篇。你的小猫会以迅雷不及掩耳的速度长大。你需要知道在各个阶段如何照顾它。同时，这个手册中对于幼猫有一些额外的关注点。尽管幼猫时期不会长久，但是你为小猫提供的一切都会给它快乐并且为你们之后的长久陪伴铺平道路。

One kitten or a pair? 养一只小猫还是养一对小猫？

This is often a personal decision for owners, based on their lifestyle, home and surrounding environment, the cat density of the local population, the extra expense of having a second kitten and personal preference. 

这通常取决于主人的个人选择。主人可以根据自己的生活方式、家庭以及周围的环境、本地猫的密度以及多养一只的花销等个人便好来进行选择。

If you are thinking of getting a pair of kittens, a sibling pair is often preferable to two unrelated kittens and character is more important than gender. If you are looking for a family pet for a busy home, look for a kitten that is alert, keen to approach visitors and playful with their litter mates. Be aware that the quiet one may potentially grow up to be an anxious or more fearful cat. This is fine if you are prepared to care for this type of cat and cater to their needs, but they may be less suited to a busy or noisy household. 

如果你在考虑同时养两只小猫，那养同一窝的两只往往要优于养两只不相干的。并且小猫的性格要比性别更重要。如果你在给忙碌的家庭寻找一只宠物猫，那最好是找一只机警、喜欢访客并喜欢和同伴玩耍的小猫。需要注意的是，小时候安静的猫长大后可能会成为更焦虑或者是害怕生人的猫。如果你准备好养这种类型的猫，能够关爱它的需要，那也没问题。不过这种猫可能并不适应忙碌吵闹的家庭。

Although two kittens homed from the same litter may remain sociable with each other as they approach adulthood, it is important that they have access to separate resources, such as litter trays and food bowls. Kittens may grow apart as they approach social maturity between 18 months and four years of age, so will need their own territory and resources to avoid conflict. For more information, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Cats living together. 

尽管来自同一窝的两只小猫领在长大后也会有社交联系，但是你仍然需要给它们每一只猫分别提供猫砂盆、食碗。在幼猫长到18个月到4岁的时候，随着社交的成熟，它们可能会分开生活，需要独立的领地和资源来避免冲突。需要更多信息，请参阅猫咪保护基础指导之群居猫篇。

Feeding 喂食

Kittens should have access to fresh water and be given commercial kitten food to ensure their nutritional needs are met. Their food should be checked and replaced at least four times daily. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and avoid giving more than the total daily recommended amount as this can lead to obesity. 

小猫应该能够喝到新鲜的水源，并且被喂给商业幼猫粮，以此来保证其营养需求得到满足。它们的食物应该每天检查替换至少四次。遵循猫粮厂家的说明，避免给予太多猫粮，否则可能会导致肥胖。

As kittens grow into adults, weight should be monitored closely to avoid under or over feeding. Speak to your vet about the most appropriate diet and feeding regime for your kitten and see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Feeding and obesity. 

在小猫成长过程中，应该紧密观察其体重，不要过多或者过少的喂食。和你的兽医联系，他会告诉你最适合小猫的食谱以及喂食方式。你也可以参阅猫咪保护基础指导之喂食与肥胖篇。

Sleep 睡眠

Kittens are really playful and can race around and then fall asleep exhausted the next moment. A sleeping kitten can be very endearing, but it is important not to disturb them as good-quality sleep is needed for their growth and development, both physically and behaviourally. Just like babies, kittens need lots of sleep, so make sure they get plenty of time to rest. 

小猫非常爱玩，有时候前一秒还在四处乱窜，下一秒就已经累的睡着了。睡着的小猫非常可爱，不过千万不要打扰它睡觉，因为无论是身体上还是精神上，高质量的睡眠对于幼猫的成长和发育非常重要。像婴儿一样，幼猫需要大量的睡眠，所以一定要确保它们得到了足够的睡眠。

Behavioural development and promoting the behaviour you want for a feline companion 行为养成以及伴侣猫的行为塑造

Kittens do not stay young for long and the correct care in the early weeks and months can help them behave in a way that is best suited to you and your home, leading to a lasting relationship. 

小猫会很快长大。早期正确的护理能够帮助它们形成更适于你或者你家庭的行为方式。

Your kitten learns what is normal and safe during a very sensitive period of development that occurs between two and eight weeks of age – the so-called ‘socialisation period’. During this time, kittens’ brains and sensory systems are still developing, and the things they see, hear, touch, smell and taste affect how this development occurs. This allows young cats to quickly understand what is normal about their world and what they should avoid. 

你的小猫在第二周到第八周的被称作“社会化阶段”的敏感时期会学到什么是正常的和安全的。在这个时期，小猫的大脑和感官系统仍在发育，它看到、听到、摸到、闻到以及尝到的东西会影响这些发育。这使得小猫能够快速理解什么是正常的，而什么是应该避而远之的。

If a kitten has been raised with its mother it is recommended that it stays with her until it is at least eight weeks of age so it can learn from her. For more information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Pregnant cats and care of young kittens. 

如果小猫和母猫一起生活，那我们建议最好让它跟着母猫直到八周龄，这样小猫能够跟母猫进行学习。需要更多信息，请参阅猫咪保护基础指导之孕猫和幼猫护理。

Socialisation and getting used to the home environment 学会社交以及适应家庭环境

The greater the variety of positive experiences kittens have between two and eight weeks of age – such as different sights, sounds and smells – the more likely they are to be able to adapt to whatever life throws at them in the future. 

幼猫两周到八周龄之间接收到正向的体验（比如不同的光线、声音、味道）越多，那它在未来可能就更容易接受可能遇到的更多新奇食物。

Kittens which have not been exposed to positive, new experiences during this sensitive period are more likely to be scared of novelty later in life. Cats born without exposure to people cannot usually be tamed and will remain scared of people throughout their lives, becoming feral cats. 

没能在这一时期接受到正向的新奇刺激的幼猫在长大后更容易被新鲜事物吓到。刚出生的幼猫没有接触到人的刺激，长大后往往不能被驯服，终其一生都会保持对人的恐惧，成为夜猫。

This is why it is important for kittens to be socialised before eight weeks of age. Examples of socialisation include meeting different types of people from babies to adults, being gently touched and handled, and getting used to hearing different sounds – such as the noise of the washing machine and vacuum cleaner – while ensuring the kittens find these experiences enjoyable rather than threatening. 

这就是为什么要在幼猫八周龄之前对其进行社交训练的原因。社交训练的方式包括接触从婴儿到成人等不同类型的人，被轻柔的抚摸以及怀抱，幼猫会习惯听到不同的声音，比如洗衣机和吸尘器的噪声，把这些噪声视为愉悦的体验而不是潜在的威胁。

Kittens exposed to unrelated, non-aggressive cats while they are very young are more likely to be able to cope with the presence of other cats as adults. Likewise, kittens are more likely to form positive associations with dogs if they have positive interactions with dogs during the socialisation period. 

幼猫时期接触过不相干、没有进攻性其他猫的猫，长大后更容易接受其他猫的出现。同样，如果在社交化时期幼猫和狗产生正向的互动，那长大后和狗的关系就会融洽很多。

However, most kittens do not stay in the home in which they are born and are acquired by their owners when they are aged eight weeks or over. This means they are approaching the end of this ‘window of opportunity’ to learn what is normal about their world. When choosing a kitten, try to find out how well socialised it is, so that you can choose a kitten most likely to adapt to your home. 

然而， 绝大多数小猫都不会一直待在自己出生的家庭中，往往会在八周龄或者之后被其真正的主人接走。这也意味着新主人接到小猫时候已经到了这个养成认知“机遇期”的末端。当选择小猫的时候，尽量了解其社交化的程度如何，这样你才能选到最适合你家庭的小猫。

When kittens over eight weeks of age are introduced to new experiences, it is important to go at a slow pace. Providing them with a quiet, dedicated room and allowing them to explore at their own pace will help them to build confidence and reduce the risk of anxiety and behavioural problems. Patience at the start will reap rewards later. 

当超过八周龄的幼猫们被引入新的环境时，一定要缓慢推进。给他们提供一个安静、专门的房间，让其自主探索，这样能够帮助建立它们的自信，降低焦虑和其他行为问题的风险。开始阶段付出的耐心，会在之后收到回报。

Encouraging appropriate play 鼓励恰当的玩耍

A common reason for cats showing aggression towards people is due to learning at a young age that this is a good way of interacting. During normal development, kittens start to play with each other at four weeks old, as a way of practising hunting. Between five to six weeks of age, kittens will show hiding and searching behaviours that are either directed at another kitten or an object in their environment. 

猫对人展示出进攻性很常见的原因是因为它在幼年时期把这种进攻理解成了一种好的互动。一般来说，幼猫会在四周大的时候和其他幼猫开始玩耍，这也是一种狩猎的演练。在第五周和第六周的时候，幼猫会开始出现躲藏、搜寻的行为，这些行为会指向其他幼猫或者是环境中的其他事物。

Direct object play starts a little later and is particularly noticeable between seven and eight weeks of age. To start with, kittens play with all sorts of objects, but as they develop, mothers provide opportunities to direct their kittens’ behaviour towards appropriate prey items. Object play helps kittens to develop their balance and eye-paw co-ordination. Social play, including chasing behaviour, continues until it peaks at approximately 12 to 14 weeks. 

直接玩弄物品会在稍晚出现，在七周龄和八周龄之间最为显著。一开始，幼猫会玩所有类型的物体。但是在这个过程中，母猫会引导小猫去玩那些适合作为猎物的物品。对物品的玩弄帮助幼猫形成平衡感以及眼睛-爪子的协调一致。之后幼猫们会出现社交化的玩耍（包括追逐的行为），这个阶段会在12周龄到14周龄达到顶峰。

Often this type of predatory aggression appears as ‘ambushing’ where the cat lies in wait, ready to attack as soon as someone walks by. To avoid this, don’t encourage your kitten to play with your hair, fingers or toes. If they try to pounce on them, keep perfectly still, so there is nothing exciting for them to chase. 

通常来说这种狩猎的行为会在某些人恰好路过时出现，幼猫会先俯身等待、准备进攻，然后突袭。为了避免这种行为，你不应该让幼猫玩弄你的头发、手指或者是脚趾。如果它们试图扑咬，你需要保持静止，这样就没有什么东西值得它们继续追逐了。

Cats showing this type of behaviour may be showing boredom. They should be provided with suitable toys to attack as this provides great mental stimulation and physical exercise. Time should be spent playing with the kitten or cat but the games should be distant from the body – for example, using ‘fishing rod’ type toys and ping pong balls. Rotate the toys often to keep the games interesting. Remember never to leave your kitten or cat unsupervised with toys which might be shredded or eaten, or cause entanglement, and check toys regularly for signs of wear, replacing when appropriate. 

出现这种行为的猫可能是因为无聊。应该给它合适的玩具供其玩耍，这样能够提供足够的精神刺激以及身体上的活动量。你应该花时间和幼猫或者成猫玩耍，但是游戏本身需要尽量不涉及你的身体。比如，用钓鱼杆式的玩具或者是乒乓球。经常晃动玩具来保持其对猫的吸引力。记住永远不要让幼猫单独和玩具在一起，因为玩具可能会被撕碎或者是吞食，也可能造成缠绊。你需要定期检查玩具是否有磨损的现象，并且适时更换。

Consistency 一致性

Be consistent in your approach to a kitten, particularly with regard to what you will and won’t allow, and make sure everyone in the household works to the same rules. For example, don’t let them in a room one day, but not another – it will confuse them and may lead to behaviour you don’t want. 

在和小猫的相处过程中要保持一致，尤其是涉及到你想要培养和禁止的相关行为的时候。确保家里的每个人都遵守同样的规范。举例来说，你不应该某一天把小猫关在房间里，其余时间又放出来。这样会让猫感到困惑，可能导致你不想要的行为。

Never punish your kitten as this can make them anxious or fearful. Gently say ‘no’ and ignore them for a short while or distract them with a toy. Reward the behaviour you do want by offering praise or a small treat. 

不要惩罚小猫，这样可能会让它们感觉焦虑或者恐惧。轻轻的说“不”并且不理它们一小会儿，你也可以用一个玩具打发它们走。你可以用表扬或者是小零食来鼓励你想要小猫作出的行为。

Remember there are certain behaviours inherent to a cat, such as hiding, climbing, hunting or predatory-style playing, toileting and scratching. Ensure you give your cat opportunities to express these which are acceptable to you both or they will find options you may find less appealing, such as shredding the curtains! 

记住，某些行为对于猫来说是天生的，比如躲藏、攀爬、狩猎或者是狩猎式的玩耍、排泄以及抓挠东西。确保你在可以接受的程度下让它们自由释放天性。否则它们会用更隐蔽的方式来释放自我，比如抓挠窗帘。

Litter training 排泄训练

When it comes to litter training, most cats are quick to learn – usually they just need to be shown the litter tray and they know what to do. Kittens learn an association between going to the toilet and the material that is under their feet. The kitten forms a preference for toileting on that type of surface and will generally prefer this material throughout life. 

排泄训练的部分，大部分猫学的很快。通常只需要带它们到猫砂盆，它们就会知道这是做什么用的。小猫会将排泄行为和脚下的质感建立一种联系。幼猫时期对某种类型的猫砂的偏好会延续到之后的猫生。

The location of the litter tray is crucial for ensuring that cats are able to find and access it easily and feel safe when using the tray. It is best to place it in a secluded corner of the room, which is away from their bed, food and water bowls – avoid busy walkways. It is important that your kitten is not disturbed while using the litter tray. Try to provide the litter type they have been accustomed to using already, and make any changes gradually. 

猫砂盆的位置很重要，合适的位置能够让猫更加容易找到并进出，同时感到安全。最好是把猫砂盆放在房间中僻静的一个角落，远离它的猫窝、食物、水碗，同时还要离人常常走动的线路远一些。在猫使用猫砂盆的时候，千万不要去打扰它。尽量提供它们之前就适应的猫砂种类，做改变的时候要循序渐进。

Remember that kittens grow up quickly and will soon need a larger, adult-sized tray instead of their kitten tray. 

记住小猫长的很快，你不久之后就需要一个更大的成猫尺寸的猫砂盆了。

Grooming 梳理毛发

Whether you have a short-haired or long-haired kitten, it is important to gently groom them regularly so they get used to the feeling of being brushed. There are a variety of kitten brushes and grooming tools available. Grooming will help to keep your kitten’s coat and skin healthy. 

无论你养的是短毛猫还是长毛猫，定期给它梳毛都是很重要的，这样能让它们适应被刷毛的过程。市场上能买到很多种幼猫用的毛刷和梳理工具。梳毛能够帮助你的小猫保持被毛皮肤健康。

Groom your kitten for short periods while offering praise or small treats so that they form a positive association with grooming. Many cats need to be groomed regularly, particularly when they are elderly as they can struggle to keep their coat in good condition. It is much less stressful for the cat if they have been introduced to grooming at a young age. Grooming is also a great way to bond with your cat and some cats really enjoy being brushed. It is also a useful opportunity to check for injuries or lumps on the body. 

可以在梳毛一小会之后表扬它或者是给它小零食，这样就能让小猫形成对梳毛的正向联系。很多猫都需要定期梳毛，尤其是当它们年龄变大不能很好的保持被毛清洁的时候。如果小的时候经常被梳毛，长大后就更不会对梳毛感到焦虑。梳毛也是和你的猫建立情感联系的绝佳方式，很多猫也很享受被梳毛的过程。同时这也是检查猫是否有受伤或者是硬块的好机会。


Veterinary care 医学护理

Find a vet 找个兽医

You will need to register your kitten with a vet. A recommendation from a friend or neighbour is a great place to start. Alternatively, you could phone around or visit the practice before making your choice. It’s important to build a good relationship with your vet. Take your kitten for a health check as soon as you can, as well as any time that they are ill or injured. 

你需要给你的猫确定一个兽医。来自朋友或者是邻居的建议是个很好的开始。你也可以先打电话或者是造访附近的宠物医院，之后再做出选择。和兽医建立良好关系很重要。尽快带你的小猫去做个体检，如果它们受伤或者生病也要及时就医。

Due to their small body size and immature immune systems, a kitten’s health can deteriorate very quickly, so take them straight to the vets if they are unwell. Discuss all aspects of your cat’s care with your vet and consider taking out pet insurance to ensure you can afford veterinary treatment should your cat be injured or fall ill unexpectedly. For more information see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: You and your vet. 

因为小猫的身体太小，免疫系统还不成熟，一旦生病，其健康状况可能很快就会恶化。所以一旦发现不好的状况，你需要直接带它去就医。你可以和兽医讨论养猫的方方面面，另外你也可以考虑给猫买一份保险，来应对意外出现的受伤和疾病带来的治疗费用。需要更多信息，请参阅猫咪保护医学指导之你的你的兽医篇。

Vaccination 免疫

Kittens should be vaccinated from eight or nine weeks of age and they require a second vaccination from 12 weeks of age to protect them against some serious infectious diseases. Even if your kitten is kept indoors, it is recommended that they are vaccinated as they may be at risk of disease from other animals in the household or infections that have accidentally been transferred in from outside on an owner’s hands, shoes or clothes.

小猫在第八周或者第九周的时候应该进行免疫，并且在第十二周的时候应该接受第二次免疫来抵御一些严重的传染病。即便你的猫只养在室内，也应该进行免疫，因为它们同样可能会因为家中其他动物或者是通过主人的手、鞋子、衣物从外界带来传染源而患上疾病。

Speak to your vet to discuss your kitten’s specific vaccination needs. For more information see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Infectious disease and vaccination. 

你可以和兽医聊一下小猫具体的免疫需求。需要更多信息，请参阅猫咪保护医学指导之传染病和免疫篇。

Microchip 芯片植入

Cats Protection recommends microchipping as the safest and simplest means of permanently identifying your cat. A microchip carries a unique number linked to a database holding your contact details, allowing you to be quickly traced should they stray and be scanned. Be sure to get your kitten microchipped before letting them outside for the first time. For more information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Microchipping. 

Cat Protection 把芯片植入作为最安全便捷的标志猫的手段。芯片会携带有唯一编号，会对应你在数据库中的联系方式。一旦猫走失并被扫描，你就能被第一时间联系到。在放小猫出门之前，一定要带它做芯片植入。需要更多信息，请参阅猫咪保护基础指导之芯片篇。

Parasites 寄生虫

There are many different types of parasites that can affect cats and some can be especially harmful to kittens. Veterinary products to protect against fleas and worms are effective and safe but it is important to seek advice from your vet and follow product instructions carefully. For more information see Cats Protection’s Veterinary Guide: Fleas and other parasites. 

有很多种寄生虫能感染猫，有一些对幼猫尤其有害。除虫去虱的产品通常都很有用，不过一定要遵循医生的建议，遵守产品使用说明。需要更多信息，请参阅猫咪保护医学指导之跳蚤和其他寄生虫篇。

Neutering 绝育

Neutering – spaying for females and castration for males – can be carried out at four months of age or younger. Neutered cats may live healthier lives and it is the most humane way to stop unwanted pregnancies and minimise the unwanted cat population. Neutering also prevents some cancers and reduces straying, fighting and spraying. For more information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Neutering – family planning for felines. 

绝育可以在四个月大或者更早时候进行。绝育过后的猫会活得更加健康，并且也是控制猫咪数量方法中最为人道的一种。绝育对于预防癌症以及避免走失、减少打架或者是喷尿等行为的发生同样有帮助。需要更多信息，请参阅猫咪保护基础指导之绝育篇。


Hazards 潜在危险

Kittens are very inquisitive and love to explore, but be aware that there can be hazards around the house. While you must always make sure your cat has a safe retreat where they can hide, it’s important to kitten-proof the house to help keep your kitten safe. Kittens can squeeze into the smallest of spaces and have a habit of sleeping in peculiar places. 

幼猫非常富有好奇心，喜欢探索。但是你需要注意的是，家中各处可能会有很多潜在危险。尽管家中一定要给小猫留有一个能够躲藏的庇护所，但是做好各种防护也是必不可少的工作。幼猫能够挤进非常狭窄的空间，也经常会在各种奇怪的地方睡觉。

Block off any gaps between cupboards, furniture and kitchen appliances. Screen off open fireplaces and always supervise your kitten if you have lit a fire. Keep cupboards, washing machines and tumble driers closed. Toilet lids should be kept down, to avoid the risk of drowning or coming into contact with cleaning chemicals. Ensure that hot liquids are never left unsupervised. Keep all cables and wires securely protected and out of reach. 

消除任何碗柜、家具、厨房用具之间的空隙。封闭壁炉。如果你在生火，一定要随时监控幼猫。把碗柜、洗衣机、滚筒式烘干机关好。马桶盖应该放下，避免幼猫溺亡或者是接触到清洁用的化学制品。确保热水等液体不要离开视线。把所有线缆、电缆收好防护好，避免猫能够接触到。

Kittens should never have access to balconies and all external doors and windows should be kept closed, or safely fenced over with strong wire mesh, ensuring there are no gaps that your kitten could fall through. It is best to check kittens regularly through the day to ensure they haven’t got up to any mischief. 

小猫不应该能够进入到阳台。任何能够通往外界的门窗都应该关严，或者是用坚固的丝网隔离开。确保丝网的空隙不足以让小猫漏过去。最好是定时查看小猫，以免它在调皮。

For further advice on potential hazards, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Keeping your cat safe.

Bringing a new kitten home 
带一只小猫回家

The first few hours after bringing any cat home can really affect how well they accept their new life. First and foremost, be prepared to be patient and never attempt to rush your kitten into doing things they may not be ready for. Being creatures of habit, a change of environment is always stressful for a cat, so it will often take a few weeks for them to gradually settle and feel safe in their new home. 
带任何一只猫回家最初的几个小时都会很大程度上影响他们对新生活的适应情况。首先，你需要有足够的耐心，不要强迫幼猫做任何它不想做的事情。作为循规蹈矩的动物，环境变化对于猫来讲通常都会带来巨大压力，所以通常都需要几周的时间来适应。

Before collecting your kitten, set aside a dedicated, secure room. This area should include their food and water bowls, litter tray and ideally something that smells familiar that they have previously put their own scent on. 
在接回你的幼猫之前，你需要准备一个独立的安静的房间。在里面放上食物和水，猫砂盆，最好是放上有幼猫气味的物件。


It is best not to leave a kitten alone until they have settled. Provide them with a warm, secure bed at ground level – a cardboard box will do. Once they’ve had a look around, show them where their litter tray, bowls and bed are by gently tapping these items. They may feel a little unsettled if they are used to living with their mother and siblings, so when you are not there, a soft toy or low-volume radio might help them feel at ease. 
在幼猫适应下来之前，最好是不要让它单独相处。在地面上给它找个温暖安全的窝，比如一个纸壳箱就可以。一旦它开始四处观望，你可以通过轻轻拍猫砂盆、食物碗、水碗以及猫窝来告诉幼猫这些东西的存在。之前和母猫或者是其他幼猫生活在一起，幼猫现在可能会感到不适应，所以当你不在周围的时候，可以把一个柔软的玩偶或者是声音低沉的收音机放到它身边，这样幼猫会感觉好些。

Introducing your kitten to others in the household 
把幼猫介绍给其他家庭成员

Kittens and children 
幼猫和孩子

Although kittens are more fragile and injured more easily than adult cats, they can still be a suitable pet for children providing there are careful measures in place to ensure a mutually beneficial relationship. Growing up with a pet can be an extremely rewarding experience for any youngster. Many children regard their cat as their best friend and it is through this friendship that important lessons are learned in trust, empathy, care and love, which help children become responsible and caring adults. When choosing a kitten, look for one that is responsive, energetic and happy to approach. Don’t allow any encounters that hurt or frighten the kitten as it may lead to a negative association and the kitten may grow up to resent being handled. 
尽管幼猫很娇嫩，比成年猫更容易受伤。在适当的防护措施下，幼猫还是能作为孩子的宠物的。很多孩子都把猫当成是自己最好的伙伴。在和猫的成长友谊中，孩子们会学会信任、同情、关怀和爱。这会让孩子们更加具有责任感，也更关爱老人。在挑选幼猫的时候，要挑选那种反应热烈、充满活力、易于接近的猫。避免在和猫的相处中产生碰撞和强制，这会造成负面的情感关联，会让猫长大后畏惧被人抱起。

From their earliest days, children can be taught to be gentle and kind with kittens. Children learn best by example, so if you treat your kitten gently with love and respect, it’s more likely your children will grow up to do the same. 
一开始，就应该教导孩子们轻柔的对待幼猫。孩子有样学样，所以如果你自己对待幼猫就很轻柔有爱，那孩子们也会如此这般。

When your children are old enough to understand, explain that kittens like to be left alone when sleeping, hiding, toileting or eating and that they can become frightened when people shout, make sudden movements or try to grab them. Kittens are very active and care needs to taken as they can climb up legs, or inadvertently scratch or bite while playing. Children soon learn to interpret the signs of an unhappy cat – the swishing tail, ruffled-up fur or hissing – and will avoid doing things that upset them. 
当孩子长到足够大能够理解时候，向他们解释幼猫在睡觉、躲藏、上厕所、吃饭的时候不希望被打扰，而且大声喊叫、突然的动作或者是尝试抓猫的行为可能会吓到幼猫。幼猫非常活跃，当它们爬到人的腿上、或者是在玩耍的时候不经意抓挠或者咬人，这时候就需要采取一些措施。孩子们之后应当能够把一些行为（抖动的尾巴、立起的猫毛或者是嘶叫声）同猫的不良情绪联系到一起，并且避免做出会惹怒猫的事情。

Your children will love helping to take care of your kitten too, so involve them in the feeding, grooming and playing routines and you’ll have happy children and a happy kitten! 
你的孩子也会喜欢帮忙照顾幼猫，所以可以带孩子一起给猫喂食、梳毛、玩耍。这样你会同时拥有快乐的孩子以及快乐的幼猫。

Kittens should be provided with a room or area in the house that is out of bounds to children, especially as kittens need to sleep for long periods frequently throughout the day. When they are awake, they need short intensive play sessions, while ensuring that they do not become too exhausted. 
由于其需要长时间且频繁的睡眠，幼猫应当有个孩子接触不到的地方能够休息。在它醒着的时候，需要短时间的活动，但是需要确保它们的活动量不要过大。

Fishing rod toys are a great way for children to interact safely with kittens, while teaching the kitten appropriate items to which to direct play behaviour. Water and food should be readily available and easy to find so they can feed little and often. Small treats can be given to kittens to form positive associations with children. For more information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Cats and people. 
钓鱼线玩具是孩子和猫咪进行安全互动的绝佳工具。这样能够教会幼猫应该追逐的物体是什么样的。水和食物应该在手边，这样能够及时、少量、频繁的进行喂食。为了形成猫咪和孩子之间正向的联系，可以给一些小零食，需要更多信息，请参阅猫咪保护基础指导之猫和人群篇。

Kittens and cats 
幼猫和成年猫

Introducing unfamiliar cats and kittens should be done very slowly and there is no guarantee that they will peacefully cohabit. This process can be helped by providing separate bowls and litter trays in a variety of different places in the home to avoid conflict and competition. 

介绍成猫或者是幼猫互相认识这一过程需要缓慢进行，而且不一定能保证成功率。在家中不同的地方提供分开的食碗以及猫砂盆，这样能够避免猫之间的冲突和斗争。

If cats are forced together too quickly, it may lead to lifelong conflict and stress which is difficult to resolve – first impressions are all important. For more detailed information on introducing cats, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guides: Cats living together and Welcome home.

Kittens and dogs 幼猫 和 狗 

A slow and gradual introduction can make all the difference when introducing a kitten and a dog to each other. However, this is no guarantee of success and some cats will never get along with a dog. 

It can be easier if both the kitten had positive experiences with dogs during the socialisation period of two to eight weeks of age and vice versa. For detailed information on introducing kittens to dogs, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Welcome home. 


Letting your kitten outside 

Sadly, many young cats are lost through straying or being involved in road traffic accidents. Even so, allowing your cat outside access will provide them with enrichment and opportunities to express their natural behaviour. It is sensible to take adequate precautions before first letting your kitten outside. Don’t risk letting your kitten outside until they have: 

. adjusted to their new indoor environment and considers it home. The time this takes will depend on the individual kitten, but will usually be a few weeks at least. Your kitten should be showing confidence around you and others in the home and they will have built up a scent profile enabling them to find their way back 

. been fully vaccinated to protect them against some infectious diseases they may encounter outside 

. been neutered. Cats reach sexual maturity from four months of age, and sadly many young cats are lost or injured in road traffic accidents while exploring their new environments and searching for suitable mates. Neutering may reduce this risk. At least ensure only supervised access outside before neutering and ensure your kitten is booked in for neutering promptly 

. been microchipped. It is important that you can be traced quickly in case your kitten becomes lost and is found by someone else 

When you do let them out: 

. do it when it is quiet and just before a mealtime when they are hungry so you can call them back with their favourite food 

. open the door and step outside, encouraging your cat to go with you 

. don’t pick them up. Let them make the decision to go outside themselves 

. leave the door open so they can run back into the house if they feel insecure 

. only let they out for short periods at first. You can gradually build up the time they are out until you are confident they can come and go as they please. Always keep them in at night, to protect them from injury and reduce hunting of wildlife 

. make sure the immediate environment does not contain hazards – see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Keeping your cat safe for more tips

Cat flap training 

Kittens usually learn how to use a cat flap quite quickly. Start training them by holding the door open and luring them near the cat flap with small, palatable treats – perhaps part of their daily food ration. Give them the treats to reward their progress little and often while training. Hold the treat the other side of the cat flap and call them to encourage them to walk through the cat flap. Repeat this process until they will happily walk through the cat flap in both directions. The next step is to gradually lower the cat flap, so that it is only partially open. They will soon need to push against it slightly in order to go through. Continue to provide encouragement, praise and treats until you can eventually shut the cat flap and they will pass through happily.
