Neutering – family planning for felines 
绝育 - 猫科繁衍计划


Cats Protection believes that getting your cat neutered before it can breed is an essential part of responsible cat ownership. Cats are very effective breeders and the number of kittens they produce increases in line with the amount of food and shelter available. Without neutering, the UK’s cat population can quickly get out of control. Please don’t add to the plight of the thousands of unwanted cats already out there. Overpopulation increases feline infectious disease, stress-related disease, feline conflict and compromises cats’ welfare. 

Cats Protection认为给自己的猫及时绝育是一个负责人的主人应该做的。猫是繁殖能力很强的动物，在有吃有住的情况下，小猫的数量将会直线上升。不对猫进行绝育，英国的猫的数量将会快速失控。请不要再让已经数量巨大的流浪猫大军增员了。猫的数量过多将会增加猫科疾病的发生、因焦躁受惊产生的疾病发生、猫之间的冲突，这些都会降低猫的生活品质。

What is neutering? 

什么是绝育？

Neutering is a surgical operation which stops female cats – queens – from becoming pregnant and male cats – toms – from making females pregnant. 

绝育是一种外科手术，会使母猫不再怀孕，公猫不再具有让母猫怀孕的能力。

. A female cat is spayed – her ovaries and uterus (womb) – are removed 

· 母猫被绝育时它的卵巢和子宫会被摘除。

. A male cat is castrated – his testicles are removed 

· 公猫被绝育的时候它的睾丸被摘除。

Cats Protection generally recommends that kittens are neutered at around four months of age or younger – although your cat can be neutered at any age. Neutering is the best way to deal with the problems of unwanted pregnancies, by preventing the problem in the first place. Neutering also prevents some cancers and infections, reduces straying, fighting and spraying. 

Cats Protection通常建议幼猫在四个月大甚至是更小的时候进行绝育。虽然绝育可以在猫的任何年龄进行。绝育作为预防手段，是防止意外怀孕最好的办法。绝育同时还能避免某些癌症和感染的发生，减少猫出现来回走动、打架以及喷尿的情况。

When to neuter? 

何时绝育？

Traditionally, cats were neutered from six months of age. However, current scientific data indicates that there are no disadvantages in neutering at a younger age – for example, from eight weeks onwards. As kittens can reach sexual maturity and breed from four months, Cats Protection generally recommends that kittens are neutered at around four months of age or younger. 

普遍的做法是在六个月大的时候给猫绝育。不过最新的科学研究表明在这之前（比如八周大的时候）绝育也没有什么影响。鉴于幼猫能在四个月大的时候达到性成熟，Cats Protection建议在四个月的时候对幼猫进行绝育。

Why neuter? 
为什么做绝育？

Neutering has many health benefits, as well as helping to reduce the number of unwanted cats in the UK. 

绝育会给猫带来很多健康上的好处，同时能控制英国流浪猫的数量。

Unneutered – ‘entire’ – male cats: 

未经绝育的“完全正常”的公猫：

. are more likely to end up injured or catch diseases from fighting, with subsequent suffering and vet bills 

· 更容易因为打架受伤或者患上疾病，随之而来的，不光是伤痛，还有兽医的收费单。

. routinely travel a large territory of many miles in search of unneutered females, risking road accidents and injury and meaning you miss the contact of having a pet cat 

· 会在几公里的范围内定期搜寻未被绝育的母猫，这会增加其发生交通事故的风险。同时，也意味着你养的不算是一只宠物猫。

. will spray smelly urine to mark territory and attract females 

· 会喷洒气味很重的尿液来标记领地、吸引异性。

. are at risk of tumours of the testicles 

· 会有几率罹患睾丸肿瘤

. are not better hunters than unneutered cats, as hunting is not a sexual behaviour 

· 并不会比已经绝育的猫更善于捕猎，因为捕猎并不算是性相关的行为。

. may experience a high level of stress akin to frustration if unable to find a mate 

· 如果找不到配偶，那可能会感到高度受挫。



Conversely, neutered male cats: 

与之相反，绝育后的公猫：

. are less likely to roam, reducing the risk of them suffering from car accidents 

· 更不容易狂奔，减少了交通意外的风险。

. are less likely to fight which reduces the risk of them getting injured or contracting serious diseases such as Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) or Feline Leukaemia Virus (FeLV) 

· 更不容易和其他猫打架，减少了因打架受伤或者是染上猫免疫缺陷病毒（FIV）或猫白血病病毒（FeLV）的风险。

. are less likely to spray 

· 更不容易喷尿。

. are unable to develop tumours of the testicles 

· 不可能患上睾丸肿瘤

. make better pets and are more likely to be ‘homebodies’ 

· 成为更好的宠物，表现的更为居家


Unneutered – entire – female cats: 

未绝育的“完整”母猫：

. frequently become pregnant from four months of age 

· 从四个月大开始经常性的怀孕

. will often have litters of kittens three times a year. This adds to the overpopulation problem and increases costs for the owner, especially if there are complications during pregnancy or birth 

· 每年能生三窝幼猫，这会加剧流浪猫问题。尤其对于孕期和生产过程中出现意外的猫，主人的花费会更加巨大。

. will call and wail every three weeks during the breeding season – January to August – to attract a mate, until they become pregnant 

· 在繁殖季（一月到八月）会每三周发作嚎叫，吸引公猫，直到怀孕为止。

. are more likely to contract diseases spread through sexual contact and mating behaviour 

· 更容易因为性接触以及交配行为染上疾病

. are at risk of cancers of the ovaries, uterus and mammary glands, as well as developing pyometra, a serious infection of the womb 

· 有患卵巢癌，子宫癌和乳腺癌的风险，以及发生子宫肌瘤，严重子宫感染的风险。


Conversely, neutered female cats: 

与之相反的是，绝育过后的母猫：

. won’t become pregnant, so there will be no expense associated with litters of kittens 

· 不会怀孕，也不会有因为幼猫的额外开销。

. do not call or wail as unneutered queens do – so less disturbed sleep for the owner and neighbours! 

· 不会像未绝育的母猫一样嚎叫，因此不会吵到主人以及邻居。

. are less likely to contract diseases such as FIV and FeLV spread by bites and mating behaviour 

· 更不容易染上FIV或者FeLV等因撕咬或者交配传播的疾病

. are unable to develop cancer of the ovaries or uterus. They are also at greatly reduced risk of developing mammary cancer – especially if neutered early 

· 不会得卵巢或子宫癌。如果在早期进行绝育，也会大大降低患乳腺癌的风险


The kittens born following an unplanned pregnancy: 

因为意外怀孕而降生的幼猫可能会面对：

. may be at risk of disease 

· 有患病的危险

. cost a lot to look after and be provided with veterinary care – far more than is likely to be recouped from trying to sell them in a market where there are plenty already 

· 照顾以及医疗花销很高，远远超过之后从已经饱和的市场中卖出的获利。

. may find themselves homeless 

· 可能会无家可归

. may deprive another unwanted cat or kitten from finding a new home as there are not enough homes to go round 

· 可能会使得另一只流浪猫无家可归，因为能收养的家庭有限。

Many owners don’t know which roaming ‘stranger’ cats their unneutered pet may have mated with, so are unaware of the potentially fatal infectious diseases that the cat may have been infected with. Also the temperament of the tom can affect the behaviour of any offspring which are born. Risking mating with an unknown ‘stranger’ can lead to the birth of kittens that are unsuitable as family pets. 

很多主人不清楚和家里未绝育的宠物猫交配的会是哪一只野猫，所以就有被传染上致命疾病的可能。同样，公猫的性格会影响后代的幼猫，冒险让猫和野猫交配可能会生出性格不适合家养的幼猫。

The operation 手术本身

Your cat will need to spend a day at the veterinary surgery and will be given a general anaesthetic, so no food should be offered in the hours prior to the operation. Your vet will advise you about when you should feed. The operation for both male and female cats is very simple and usually you will be able to drop your cat off and pick them back up on the same day. 

你的猫会在兽医诊所待一天的时间，并且会被施以全身麻醉。所以在手术前的几小时应该禁食。兽医会告诉你什么时候应该喂食。无论是公猫还是母猫，手术都很简单，你可以在当天取回做完手术的猫。

Afterwards, a female cat will have a small shaved area on her side or belly – this hair will grow back in a few weeks. She will also have stitches and if these are not dissolvable, they will be taken out by the vet around 10 days later. 

之后，你会发现母猫的侧部或者是腹部的一小块毛被剃掉（通常会在几周内重新长出来）。同样会有缝合的痕迹，如果缝合线不是自融的，那兽医会在十天后拆线。

Cats are very resilient and stoical – far more so than humans – and usually recover very quickly from the operation. Your vet will advise on the best care for your cat as he or she recovers. Kittens seem to recover even more quickly than adult cats. Your cat will require much less food after neutering, as his or her body has less work to do, so you will probably need to monitor your cat’s weight and reduce the amount of food provided to prevent your cat from becoming too fat. This will also save you money too! 

猫具有很强的忍耐力和生命活力 - 远远超过人类 - 通常会很快从手术中恢复过来。 兽医会为你的猫提供最好的恢复期护理建议。 小猫通常比成年猫恢复得更快。因为消耗量减少，你的猫在绝育后所需食物会减少很多。所以你可能需要监测你的猫的体重并减少食物的提供量以防止你的猫变得太胖。当然这也会省钱。

How much does it cost? 绝育费用多少？

The cost of the operation varies according to where you live. The average cost for a male cat is between ￡30 and ￡60 and the average cost for a female cat is between ￡40 and ￡80. Your vet will be happy to give you a quote before the operation takes place and we recommend phoning a number of veterinary practices. Cats Protection offers financial assistance to cat owners on benefits or low income in some cases. For more details visit www.cats.org.uk/neutering or phone 03000 12 12 12. 

绝育这项手术的费用取决于你的住处。公猫的绝育费用普遍在30英镑到60英镑之间。母猫的绝育费用则在40英镑和80英镑之间。你的兽医通常会很高兴在手术前报价，我们建议你多致电几个兽医诊所询价。Cats Protection对领用救济金以及低收入的猫主人会提供经济上的帮助。需要更多信息，请登录www.cats.org.uk/neutering或致电 03000 12 12 12. 

Find a vet to neuter your cat 找到合适的兽医

While almost all vets will offer neutering, some do not routinely offer neutering before six months, although the numbers are rapidly increasing thanks to support from groups including the British Small Animal Veterinary Association (BSAVA). To find a veterinary practice near you which offers earlier neutering, please visit Cats Protection’s website www.cats.org.uk 

尽管所有的兽医都能够进行绝育手术，而且多亏了英国小动物兽医协会的支持，越来越多的兽医能够给六月龄之前的猫绝育。不过有些兽医确实不会提供。你可以登录Cats Protection的网站 www.cats.org.uk 查找附近能够进行早期绝育的兽医诊所。

Earlier neutering has been common practice in many countries, including the USA and Australia, for many years and there is a proven track record of its safety and effectiveness. Studies show no evidence of long-term negative developmental or behavioural effects.

较早绝育已经成为包括美国和澳大利亚在内很多国家的惯例，很多年的实践证明了这种方式的安全性和有效性。研究表示较早绝育并不会带来长期负面的影响。

Improved techniques and drugs have meant that former concerns over the risks of surgery are unwarranted and it is felt that young kittens recover from the operation much more quickly than adult cats. 

更为先进的技术以及药物使得绝育的风险更小，并且幼猫通常比成年猫恢复的更快。

Facts to dispel the neutering myths 
关于绝育的辟谣

. Cats can start breeding from just four months of age 
· 猫能在四个月大的时候繁殖

. Kittens can be safely neutered before six months of age 
· 幼猫在六个月前能够安全的进行绝育

. Cats will readily breed with their brothers, sisters and parents 
· 猫会同其兄弟姐妹以及父母进行繁殖

. It is not beneficial for a cat to have a season or ‘just one litter’ before being spayed 
· 让猫在绝育之前先发情或者是怀一窝小猫并没有什么好处。

. The length of pregnancy in cats is just nine weeks and a female cat can often come into season again just six weeks after giving birth 
· 母猫孕期只有短短的九周，生产之后六周就可以再次发情。

. A cat can quite easily have up to three litters a year with five or six kittens in each. That adds up to 18 caring homes for Cats Protection to find each year, just for one cat’s kittens! This level of breeding is very draining and can be harmful for the mother cat 
· 一只猫在一年内能够很容易生下三窝小猫，每窝五六只。这样一来Cats Protection就需要找18个能够接收幼猫的家庭，而这仅仅是因为一只猫。这种强度的繁殖消耗巨大而且可能对母猫有害。

. One unneutered female cat can be responsible for 20,000 descendants in just five years – unneutered cats are very good at finding each other and unplanned, unwanted pregnancies are all too common 
· 一只没有绝育的母猫可能会对接下来五年的20000只后代负责。未绝育的公猫母猫很擅长找到同样无未绝育的同类进行交配，计划外的生育很常见。

. Neutered cats do not ‘miss’ their organs or opportunities to reproduce or rear a litter – they are not people! 
· 绝育过的猫不是人，并不会想念它们的器官或者是怀念生育、哺育幼猫的机会

. Neutering even if a queen is in season, pregnant or lactating can be performed and is best discussed with your vet 
· 母猫在发情期、孕期或者是哺乳期都可以进行绝育，具体请和你的兽医咨询。

While the majority of owners do neuter their cats, sadly a large number of owned cats are allowed to breed before being neutered, adding to the overpopulation problem and the demand on overstretched animal charities. Please don’t leave it too late. Speak to your vet and book your cat’s neutering appointment today. It should benefit your cat, it may prevent your cat suffering and it is the most important action you can take to help the wider cat population. 

尽管大部分主人确实给猫做绝育，但是不幸的是仍然有很多猫被允许繁育。这样会带来猫科动物数量过多的问题，也给动物福利机构带来了很大的压力。请不要过晚进行绝育。请尽快和兽医咨询并预定绝育时间。绝育会给你的猫带来好处，避免其遭受疾病。也是你能为控制猫科动物数量做的最重要的一步！
