Cats and the law 猫咪以及相关法律


Much of the law in relation to animals has now been consolidated in the Animal Welfare Act 2006 which applies in England and Wales, the Animal Health & Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and the Welfare of Animals Act (Northern Ireland) 2011. This leaflet also refers to other legislation which remains relevant. 

很多与动物相关的法律现在都已经被整合进了2006年英格兰和威尔士施行的动物福利法案、2006年苏格兰的动物健康及福利法案，以及2011年北爱尔兰动物福利法案。本手册也援引了其他一些相关法条。



Animal Welfare Act 2006 2006动物福利法案

The Act contains provisions which are aimed at preventing cruelty and promoting and ensuring the welfare of animals. 
本法案为避免动物遭受残酷行径并促进动物生活水平，制定以下规定：

The Act applies to both domestic and feral cats. In addition to cruelty offences, the Act now places an obligation on owners – as well as those in charge of or responsible for cats – to ensure that their welfare needs are met, emphasising the need: 

本法案适用于家猫以及野猫。在涉及暴力侵害的情况下，本法案强制要求猫主人，以及对猫存在管控责任的人满足以下猫的需求：

. for a suitable environment – place to live 
· 有一个适合生活的舒适环境

. for a suitable diet 
· 有适宜的食物

. to exhibit normal behaviour patterns 
· 能够施展正常的天性

. to be housed with, or apart from, other animals 
· 和其他动物被养在家里，或者是远离其他动物。

. to be protected from pain, suffering, injury and disease 
· 避免其受到疼痛、伤病的折磨

The penalties for committing an offence of cruelty or for failing to provide for an animal’s welfare needs include a ban from owning animals, a fine of up to ￡20,000 or, in some cases, a six-month prison sentence. 

对于施暴的个人以及未能提供以上生活条件的主人，可能会受到“禁养宠物”“最高20000英镑罚金”的惩罚，某些情况下可能会面对六个月的监狱生涯。

The Act also increases the minimum age at which anyone can buy a cat or other animal to 16. 

本法案同样将能够领养猫或其他宠物的最低年龄限制提升至16岁。

Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 2006苏格兰动物健康及福利法案


The Scottish Act mirrors many of the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 but with some differences. For example, the Scottish Act retains the offence of abandonment, whereas in England and Wales this is covered by the cruelty offences and the duty to ensure welfare. 

苏格兰法案沿袭了很多2006动物福利法案的规定，但也有所不同。举例来说，苏格兰法案中保留了遗弃动物罪，而在英格兰和威尔士法案里这被算作是虐待动物、不履行为动物提供生活福利的行为。

Welfare of Animals Act (Northern Ireland) 2011 2011北爱尔兰动物福利法案

The Northern Irish Act mirrors the provisions of the other two Acts and, like the Scottish Act, retains the offence of abandonment. 

北爱尔兰法案沿袭了其他两个法案的规定，像苏格兰法案一样，同样保留了遗弃动物罪。

Theft Act 1968 1968年偷盗动物法案

Cats are regarded in law as the ‘property’ of their owner. The theft of a cat is treated as an offence under the Act, in the same way as theft of any other property is. 

在法律上，猫被视作是主人的“财产”。偷窃一只猫，在该法案中被视为一种犯罪，和偷盗其他财产无异。

A cat that is lost or has strayed is generally regarded as the property of the original owner. It is therefore necessary to make all reasonable endeavours to locate the original owner whenever possible. 

走失的猫依然算作是原主人的财产。所以当有可能的时候，应当竭尽所能去找寻原主人。

Criminal Damage Act 1971 1971年犯罪性伤害法案

Because the law regards cats as property, an offence may be committed under this Act if a person, without lawful excuse, kills or injures a cat belonging to another person. 

因为猫在法律上被视为财产，如果一个人在没有合法辩解的情况下，杀死或弄伤别人的猫，是要被定罪的。

The Common Law Duty of Care 看管猫的法律义务

It is a commonly held view that cats have a ‘right to roam’ wherever they wish. This view is largely based upon the fact that certain duties imposed upon the owners of dogs and livestock to keep their animals under control – the Road Traffic and Dangerous Dogs Acts – do not apply to cat owners. The law in these respects recognises that, by their nature, cats are less likely to cause injury to people or damage to property than some other animals. 

人们普遍认同的是，猫应该有权去它想去的任何地方。基于“交通安全及危险狗类法案”的要求，有些狗和家禽的主人会把这些动物圈起来。但这个法案并不适用于猫。在这些方面，法律更倾向于认为：基于天性，猫更不容易像其他动物一样致人受伤或者毁坏财物。

However, cat owners do have a general duty at law to take reasonable care to ensure that their cats do not cause injury to people or damage to property. In practice, cases involving damage to property or injury to people by cats are few and far between. 

但是，猫主人确实有法定义务采取足够的措施确保他的猫不会对人和财物造成伤害。实际上，猫致人受伤或者是财产损失的案例并不常见。

What to do if you suspect cruelty or neglect 

当你发现可能的虐待动物或者没有尽到管护义务的行为时，该怎么做？

Cats Protection is a welfare and rehoming charity and, as such, is not set up to investigate or prosecute animal welfare offences whereas the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) is structured in this way.

“猫咪保护”是一个猫咪福利以及重新安置的慈善机构，并不是为调查、起诉侵犯动物权益的行为而设立。皇家预防动物犯罪协会（RSPCA）则是专门为这种行为而设立。

The RSPCA receives reports of cruelty and abuses of the five welfare needs listed above. Reports of abandoned pets, poisoning and cruelty are on the increase. If you do suspect an animal is being neglected or subjected to cruelty in England and Wales, you should call the RSPCA’s 24-hour cruelty line – 0300 1234 999. You will be asked for a detailed description of what you have seen or heard. The RSPCA can request help from the local authorities or the police when necessary. 

皇家预防动物犯罪协会接受关于侵犯上述五种动物权益的虐待动物相关行为报告。关于遗弃宠物、毒害宠物以及虐待宠物的案例目前不断在增加。在英格兰和威尔士，如果你确实怀疑有动物遭受了虐待或者是无人看护，那你可以拨打RSPCA24小时的举报热线（0300 1234 999）。你会被要求详细叙述你所看到听到的一切。有必要时，RSPCA可能会寻求当地政府及警方的帮助。

In Scotland, contact the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA) on 03000 999 999 

在苏格兰，你可以拨打苏格兰预防动物犯罪协会(SSPCA)电话（03000 999 999）

In Northern Ireland, contact the Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (USPCA) on 028 3025 1000 

在北爱尔兰，你可以联系阿尔斯特预防动物犯罪协会（USPCA）电话（028 3025 1000）

Planning and Environmental Law 数量控制以及环境法案

If large numbers of cats are kept at a domestic residence, the Local Planning Authority may consider that the number is not incidental to the ordinary use and enjoyment of the residential property and may require the owner or occupier to make a planning application for a change of use. If this is not granted, the owner or occupier may be required to reduce the number of cats kept at the property. 

如果某个住户养了太多的猫，当地计生部门考虑到其可能不是为了正当目的，可能会要求主人提供这么多猫的用途以及繁衍计划的申请。如果申请没有被通过，那么主人可能会被要求减少养猫的数量。

Environmental Health Departments also have powers under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in respect of nuisance or hazards – such as fouling, smell and noise – caused as a result of too many cats being kept at a single property. 



If the welfare needs of cats kept in large numbers at a single property are not being met, this may constitute a breach of the duty to ensure welfare under the Animal Welfare Act and may constitute an offence under the Act. 

Pet Travel Schemes (PETS) 

The Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) allows cats and other animals to travel and enter the UK without the need for quarantine,provided that certain requirements are fulfilled. 

More information about PETS can be obtained from the government website – visit www.gov.uk or phone 0870 241 1710. See Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Moving house.
