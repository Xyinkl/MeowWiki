Feral cats 野猫


What are feral cats? 怎样才算野猫？

The term feral describes members of a domesticated species that have reverted to living as wild animals. Feral cats have had little or no contact with humans. They can never be tamed and this should never be attempted because they are very fearful of people and it would seriously compromise their welfare. Feral cats live alone – or in groups called colonies – and are found in towns, cities and rural areas. The best solution for feral cats is for them to be neutered and returned to their familiar environment. 

野猫这一词语主要指家养的宠物回归自然像野生动物一样生活。野猫没有或者很少与人接触。野猫不会被驯服，我们也不建议你去尝试驯服它，因为野猫特别怕人，驯服之后野猫的生存质量也会大大下降。野猫通常是独自生活，也有群居的。通常能在城镇、城市或者是乡村地区被找到。对于野猫，最好的办法就是对其绝育，然后放归自然。

What makes a cat feral? 是什么让猫成为野猫的？

Cats learn what is normal when they are very young kittens and their brains are developing. The point in a kitten’s life when it is aged between two and eight weeks old is known as the ‘socialisation period.’ Young kittens which have had positive contact with people and are handled during this critical time form a bond with humans and enjoy living as pets. 

猫在幼年头脑发育期会学到什么是“正常”。其成长的两周到八周之间被称为“社会化时期”。在这一期间如果幼猫接触到和人类相关的正向刺激会使其形成对人类的良性关联，将会乐于做一只宠物猫。

Feral cats are the offspring of stray, feral or abandoned domestic cats and have missed out on these early positive experiences with people. 

野猫可能是流浪猫、野猫、或者是被遗弃的家猫的后代，通常都已经错失了和人类正确相处的关键“社会化时期”

They should not be confused with stray cats which were raised as pets but have since been lost or abandoned. Although stray cats can be scared of people due to their experiences, they can often be rehabilitated and go on to live life as a pet again. Sometimes farm kittens will have been handled and treated well by farm workers and children – enabling them to adapt to life in the home. These kittens would also not generally be considered feral. 

野猫不等同于在走失或者是被遗弃的家猫。虽然流浪猫因为经历的原因可能会产生对人类的恐惧，但是通常情况下还是能够重新建立对人的信任，回归宠物生活的。有的在农场出生的幼猫由于接收了农场工人以及孩子的悉心照料，已经能够适应宠物猫的生活。这些幼猫也不应该看做是野猫。

This means that cats that haven’t become dependent on people can live well in the wild, as long as they have all the things they need. See Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Cats and people for further information. 

野猫就是那些并不依赖人类，能够自己在野外活得很好，能够自己获取所有需求的猫。更多信息可以参见猫咪保护基本指导之猫和人类篇。

How do feral cats survive? 野猫生命力如何？

Cats are extremely resourceful creatures and can adapt to many different habitats. 

猫是一种适应力极强的生物，能够适应很多种不同的环境。

Unlike pet cats which often don’t get on with other felines, feral colonies will often naturally develop. These are usually made up of groups of related females and the size of the colony is directly related to the availability of food, water and shelter. 

与宠物猫经常不能适应其他猫不同的是，野猫群落会不断扩张。野猫群落通常由有关联的母猫构成，其规模取直接取决于食物、水源、栖息地的状况。

Cats within the colony recognise each other by sharing their scent through rubbing against each other. Although they appear close, they are not completely reliant upon each other and will hunt and eat alone. If an unfamiliar cat intrudes on their territory, they will soon see it off.

在一个群落的猫会互相摩擦来共享气味，便于互相识别。虽然它们看起来很亲近，但是并不是完全依赖彼此，通常会独自狩猎和进食。如果一个陌生的猫进入了它们的领地，它们会很快把入侵者赶走。

Feral cats are not always found in colonies – some will live a solitary lifestyle. 

野猫并不全是群居，也有独自过活的。

Caring for feral cats 野猫的护理

Some people view feral cats as pests. Thankfully, many more – particularly farmers, stable owners and smallholders – value them for their role as working mousers that protect grain and feed. A healthy feral colony can really help to keep the vermin levels down. 

很多人会将野猫看做宠物。幸亏很多人尤其是农场主、业主以及小农将其看作是保护庄稼的捕鼠能手。一个正常的野猫社群确实能够将鼠患压制住。

Despite their wild nature, feral cats still benefit from a certain level of care, including: 

有别于它们的天性，野猫在以下方面可以享受到人类的关怀：

Neutering 绝育

This has major health benefits and keeps the colony size under control. Feral cats will need to be trapped in a humane cat-trap before they are neutered because they are too wild to be handled. Once a feral cat is sedated or under anaesthetic, the vet can give it a health check and treat it for parasites. After neutering the cat is released back into its territory as quickly as possible – this is so the cat does not lose the communal scent and end up being rejected by other cats in the colony. 

绝育能够带来健康上的好处，也能够帮助控制群落的规模。野猫很难被抓住，因而需要用人工制作的捕猫器抓住后进行绝育。当野猫被注射镇定剂，或者是被麻醉之后，兽医就会对其进行体检驱虫。绝育过后，野猫就会尽快被放回其领地，以免其身上的族群气味丧失，导致被族群排斥。

Regular feeding 定期喂食

Many feral cats are very resourceful and find adequate food, but it may be helpful to offer them extra help, especially in winter. Only offer food if the feral cats have been neutered. This is important because feeding unneutered cats increases the number of kittens that are born. It is also not in any cat’s interests to become fat and this is particularly true of feral cats as it affects their agility and chance of survival – so avoid overfeeding. Contrary to popular belief, regularly fed feral cats are better hunters than hungry ones. 

很多野猫适应力很强，能够找到合适的食物。不过尤其是在冬天的时候，给予其额外的食物能够帮上忙。不过只有在野猫都进行过绝育之后才提供食物。这样才不会增加新生幼猫的数量。鉴于肥胖对于任何猫都没有好处，并且很可能会影响野猫的敏捷程度，甚至可能导致生存几率降低。尽量避免过量喂食。和主流认识相反的是，经常被喂食的猫相比较饥肠辘辘的猫，捕猎效率更高。

Observation 保持观察

It is helpful to observe colonies, so that any new unneutered, sick or injured cats can be promptly trapped and taken to the vet. Only minor ailments can be treated in feral cats and sometimes they have to be euthanased on welfare grounds if they have significant illness or injury. 

保持对野猫群落的观察很重要，这样一旦有新的未绝育猫、病猫、受伤的猫出现，就能够及时捕获并且送到兽医处处置。野猫只有患上较轻的病症会进行医治，如果伤势或者病情过于严重，出于对猫生活质量的考虑，通常会进行安乐死。


What about Toxoplasmosis? 关于弓形虫?

Some farmers may be concerned that feral cats could be the source of a parasite called Toxoplasma, which can cause miscarriage in ewes. Although cats can catch Toxoplasmosis, they quickly become immune, just two weeks after being infected. Cats catch Toxoplasmosis from eating infected raw meat or rodents. The only way the disease can be transmitted is if the ewe takes in the infected cat’s faeces in its feed or water – so the risk to sheep is very is extremely low. Vets agree that there is no risk to non-pregnant, healthy sheep. 

有的农民可能会担心野猫可能带来一种叫做弓形虫的寄生虫，可能导致母绵羊的流产。尽管猫能够感染弓形虫，但却能在感染后两周就很快完成免疫。猫通过食用被感染的生肉以及鼠类感染弓形虫。唯一能够让绵羊感染弓形虫的途径就是让其通过饮水或者是饲料摄入被弓形虫感染的猫的粪便。可以说对绵羊的危害相当低。兽医们的共识是弓形虫对于健康的未怀孕的绵羊没有危害。

A healthy, stable colony of neutered cats is at much lower risk of Toxoplasmosis than allowing a breeding colony which continually produces vulnerable kittens. 

一个健康的稳定的全部绝育的野猫群落相比较于没有完全绝育的群落有着更低的感染弓形虫的风险。因为后者会经常性的产生脆弱的幼猫。

A further risk of Toxoplasma to sheep arises from other cats or kittens moving in. A feral colony will guard their territory so instead of maintaining a cat-free area, a healthy neutered feral colony is more likely to naturally keep such outsiders away. See Cats Protection Veterinary Guide: Cats and pregnant women – Toxoplasmosis for further information on this parasite. 

弓形虫的风险会伴随着其他的猫和幼猫而来。一个野猫群落会守卫自己的领地。所以严禁猫进入还不如保持一个良性健康的全部绝育的野猫群落，以此来杜绝其他入侵者带来的风险。更多关于弓形虫的信息请参阅猫咪保护医学指导之猫和孕妇-弓形虫篇。

Why not just remove feral cats? 为什么不干脆消灭野猫？

Catching and removing feral cats may temporarily reduce the numbers, but this leads to what is known as the ‘vacuum effect.’ Any cats left behind will continue to breed and others will move into the area which is clearly a good source of food and shelter. The solution is to trap, neuter and return (TNR) the cats. Over a period of years this will reduce the size of the colony. A controlled, healthy and stable colony will deter other feral cats from moving in and will keep vermin levels down. 

捉补并且去除野猫只能够短期减少野猫的数量，却会导致“真空效应”，也就是任何在搜捕中幸存的野猫包括其他地方的野猫，都会充分利用充足的资源和住处在这片区域继续繁衍。所以对野猫的策略是“诱捕-绝育-放归”。经过几年的时间，野猫群落的规模就能够得到控制。受控、健康而稳定的野猫群落则会组织其他野猫的进入并抑制鼠患的发生。

In very rare instances, relocation may be necessary but should generally be avoided. Relocation of feral cats is extremely stressful for them, as they become very dependent on the familiarity of their own environment. Feral cats should not just be released elsewhere, an appropriate habitat needs to be found and the cats need a period of adjustment while they learn where they can find food and shelter. 

在很特殊的情况下，对野猫的重新安置也是一个选项，不过通常都不会被采用。重新安置对特别依赖环境的野猫来说是压力巨大的。野猫不应该被立刻释放到某个地方，而是应该在一个适宜的地方，给它们一个适应期，让它们学会在何处能够找到食物的住所。

Remember, cats are protected by law and killing a cat constitutes an offence. 

记住，猫是收到法律保护的。杀害一只猫是违法行为。

How can Cats Protection help? CAT PROTECTION做了什么？

Adult feral cats cannot be tamed or rehomed in the domestic environment as they are wild animals. 

成年的野猫是野生动物，不能够被驯服也不能被安置到人类家中。

Cats Protection may be able to set up humane traps – similar to cages – and safely capture feral cats and take them to be neutered. This is mainly done during the evening and the traps are collected quickly to minimise stress to the cat. 

CP会设置人造捕猫器（笼子一样的器具），能够安全的捕获野猫并将其带去绝育。这项工作通常在晚上进行，捕猫器会很快回收，这样不会给猫带来太大的恐慌。

The trapped cats are taken swiftly to a veterinary surgery to be neutered, a straightforward procedure which will prevent the cat from breeding. At the same time, they will also have their ear ‘tipped’ – where between half and one cm of the tip of the left ear is removed under anaesthetic. This serves as a permanent visual mark from a distance to show the cat has been neutered, to prevent the same cat being trapped for neutering in future. After neutering, the cats will be returned back to their territory. 

被捉到的猫将会被立刻带去兽医机构进行绝育，这样野猫便不能再繁殖。同时，野猫同样会在麻醉状态下被人在耳朵上离边缘1.5厘米处打洞做标记。这一永久的标记使得这只猫不会再之后被捕获并再次进入绝育流程。绝育过后，野猫便会被放回其领地。

Trapping and neutering a large feral colony can take weeks and regular monitoring is needed to make sure that no cats are missed. Ideally, any breeding females are trapped and neutered first, to avoid growth in colony size while the process is taking place. 

捕获并绝育一个大群落的野猫可能花费数周，还需要经常监控群落保证没有落网之猫。理想情况下，在发情期的母猫优先被捕获并且进行绝育，这样能够在总的进程下尽量减少野猫群落的扩张。

Very young feral kittens can sometimes be socialised with humans through gentle handling and positive experiences before they become too fearful of people. However, genetics also plays a role in the confidence and friendliness of cats, and it can sometimes be better for the welfare of feral kittens for them also to be neutered and returned to the wild.

很小的野猫有的时候可能会被人工进行“社交化”,给予其轻柔的触碰以及正向的体验来减弱它们对人类的畏惧。无论如何，基因仍然在猫的性格形成上起了很大作用，有时为了野生幼猫的生活质量还是建议对其进行绝育后放归自然。

Responsible ownership and timely neutering is important, as feral colonies originate as the offspring of unneutered stray or abandoned domestic pet cats. Financial assistance from Cats Protection may be available to help with neutering. For more information, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Neutering – family planning for felines. 

鉴于野猫群落起源于未经绝育的流浪猫或者是遗弃猫，负责任的照顾以及准时的绝育很重要。CP可以提供对宠物猫绝育的经济援助。需要更多信息，请参加猫咪保护基本指导之绝育篇。
