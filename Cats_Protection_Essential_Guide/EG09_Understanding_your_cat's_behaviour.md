Understanding your cat's behaviour

理解猫的行为

It is the very nature and behaviour of cats that makes them one of the UK’s most popular pets today. Their independence, playfulness and curiosity are among the traits that make many cat-lovers melt. By understanding the behaviour the cat has developed to enable it to thrive in a changing world, we can learn how to best provide for our cats, meet their needs, maximise their welfare and ensure long-lasting friendships for happy cats and owners. 

正是猫的天性和行为使其跻身英国最流行宠物行列。猫的独立、贪玩、好奇心重等特质使得很多猫咪爱好者们如痴如醉。通过理解猫通过进化来适应这个世界的种种行为，我们可以给猫提供更好的条件，满足它们的需求，提高它们的福利待遇，以及保证主人和猫都能拥有长期的和睦关系。

This leaflet explains the normal behaviour of the cat and suggests some approaches to manage some of the issues that can occasionally test the owner-cat bond. If you are concerned by any aspect of your cat’s behaviour, you can look at Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Managing your cat’s behaviour, but it often helps to first consider the cat’s normal behaviour, needs and motivations. 

这个手册解释了猫的基本行为，并且对一些偶尔发生的考验猫和主人关系的问题提供了一些解决办法。如果你对猫的某些行为感到困扰，那可以参照猫咪保护基本知道之管理猫的行为篇。不过通常情况下需要首先考虑的是猫的日常行为、需求以及动机。

In order to understand the behaviour and needs of today’s pet cat, we first need to explore its wild origins. The domestic cat shares common ancestry with the African wildcat – a shy cat originating in the Middle East which has many physical and behavioural similarities with our domestic cat and is still found today. 

为了了解现在的宠物猫的行为以及需求，我们首先需要探求它们的野生祖先。家猫和非洲野猫拥有同样的祖先。非洲野猫是一种源自中东的胆小的猫，其很多外在特征以及内在习性都能在现在的家猫身上找到。

Changes in man’s farming systems led the cat to naturally evolve to become closer to humans around 10,000 years ago. This is fairly recent ‘domestication’ and with relatively little human influence over the breeding of specific cats, the domestic cat still retains many of the behaviours and needs of its wild counterparts. 

一万年之前，人类的农业体系变革使得猫开始自然而然的走进人类生活。这可以说是距现在最早而且没有人为刻意施加影响的“驯化过程”了。家猫仍然留存很多y野性的行为和需要。

African wildcat 非洲野猫

The African wildcat lives a solitary lifestyle in a harsh terrain that has a relatively small concentration of rodent prey, so the cats are dispersed over a wide area. Each wildcat maintains a large territory but exhibits many of its normal everyday behaviours in a safe core area within this territory. 

非洲野猫在恶劣的地形中孤独的生活。因为猎物分布相对较分散，因此非洲野猫分散在广阔的区域。每只野猫都统治很大的一片领土，只会在其中一个安全区域展现正常的日常行为。

As a carnivore, the wildcat only eats meat and cannot be vegetarian. It is most active at dusk and dawn when its prey is active. Hunting episodes are frequent and tiring. Not every attempt is successful, so it has evolved to hunt before it becomes hungry. Each ‘catch’ is taken back to the core area where the cat can eat without threat from larger predators or rivals. 

作为食肉动物，非洲野猫只吃肉，不能吃素。 为了捕猎，它在黄昏和黎明时最为活跃。 狩猎活动是频繁而且消耗大的，并且并非所有的尝试能成功，所以它进化出了感到饥饿之前就开始捕猎的习性。 每个猎物都会被带回到其核心领地，在那里它不会受到大型掠食者或天敌的威胁。

It does not use many facial expressions to communicate and leaves a scent profile to mark its territory. Scent marking serves as a way to communicate with other cats without having to come into contact with them – reducing the risk of fighting and injuries. 

非洲野猫并不会经常使用语言沟通而是用气味来标记它的领地。气味标记是一种能在避免接触的情况下和其他猫沟通的手段，这养能够减少冲突和受伤的风险。

When faced with a stressful situation, it prefers to make an escape, after which its stress levels return to normal ie flight rather than fight. 

面对危险的情形，非洲夜猫倾向于逃跑，之后就会放松警惕。也即非洲夜猫与其抗争，不如逃跑。

The African wildcat needs a lot of sleep because of the energy used during hunting. It will usually choose a safe, elevated sleeping spot within its core territory. The cat rotates its sleeping area – this is most likely a means of parasite control – and will often scratch to maintain its claws when it wakes up. 

由于狩猎时消耗大量的能量，非洲野猫需要大量的睡眠。它通常会选择在核心领域的一个安全并且较高的地点睡觉。并且非洲野猫会时不时变换睡觉的场所，这可能是为了控制寄生虫。在醒来的时候，它通常会磨爪子以保持爪子锋利。

A wildcat learns to dig and bury the evidence from toileting at a young age. It will choose a safe, quiet and private area towards the edge of its territory, away from sites of eating and drinking to avoid contamination. Where possible, it avoids drinking from stagnant pools and will choose a drinking source separate from where it eats and toilets – although most of a wildcat’s fluid intake comes from eating rodents, which have a high water content. 

非洲野猫在幼年时候就会学会挖坑并掩埋排泄物。它会选择远离食物水源的安静私密，并且靠近其领地边缘的地方排泄来避免污染。如果可能，它不会饮用停滞的池塘里的水，而且会在远离食物和排泄处的地方饮水。虽然一只非洲野猫的液体来源大部分是含水量很高的猎物本身。

Females call when in season and because they have large territories, males will often travel long distances to find receptive females. The number of kittens born in a litter reflects the food availability, so when food sources are low, few kittens are born. Following birth, kittens need to quickly learn what is safe and normal in their environment. Surviving kittens will find their own territory with sufficient resources once old enough. 

母猫在发情期会嚎叫，由于其很大的领地范围，公猫经常需要穿袭很长距离才能找到适宜的交配对象。每窝产下的幼猫数量取决于食物的多少。如果食物来源较少，就会诞生较少的幼猫。出生之后，幼猫需要在环境中学习何谓安全以及正常。长大的幼猫会在食物充足的情况下确定自己的领地。

Domestic cats 家猫

With its common ancestry, the domestic cat species shares many similarities with the African wildcat. Each cat is an individual and while all cats share some inherent needs, both genetics and previous experience will play a great part in shaping their behaviour. 

由于和非洲野猫拥有共同的祖先，家猫也有许多野猫的习性。尽管所有的猫都遗传了一些共通的需要，但每只猫都是独立个体，基因和经历都会在塑造其个性上起很大作用。

Perhaps one of the most striking differences between individual cats is their sociability to people. There are two recognised groups: those that are feral – wild – and those that are non-feral – pet cats, depending on their level of fear towards people. The domestic cat needs to learn to like people during its early weeks. Positive, gentle interactions and handling by humans when kittens are between two to eight weeks of age leads to cats which usually enjoy human interaction and are friendly pets. Kittens which have not been socialised during their early weeks will generally remain fearful of people and the domestic environment and become feral cats. 

猫个体之间最大的区别可能就是对人的友善程度了。根据其对人类的畏惧程度猫可以分为两种：野猫以及宠物猫。家猫需要在早期学会和人相处。在两周到八周之间积极的轻柔的和人类互动会让猫更加享受和人在一起并成为宠物猫，而没有在早期和人类交互的猫则保留了对人类的恐惧，并且成为野猫。

Feral cats 野猫

While some feral cats retain their solitary nature, in certain situations, feral cats can live in groups called colonies. Feral cats within a colony live in harmony with one another if they recognise the shared group scent and they are able to find sufficient resources such as food, water, toileting and sleeping areas. 

尽管野猫保留了特立独行的天性，但是在某些情况下，野猫也会进行群居生活。在食物、水源、排泄处、睡觉场合等生存资源足够的情况下，它们可能会在共同的群体气味下和谐共生。

They engage in social interactions such as mutual grooming and rubbing. These activities keep the ‘group scent’ topped up, allowing recognition. Despite living as a group, they will continue to hunt, eat and toilet alone. Feral cats within a colony tend to see off any ‘stranger’ cats intruding in the territory. For more information on feral cats, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Feral cats. 

群居中的野猫会进行互相的清理毛发的互动行为。这些行为能够保障群体气味的一致，方便识别。尽管群居，但是每只猫都会独自狩猎、进食以及排泄。群居状态下的野猫会赶走所有闯入他们领地的外来猫。需要更多关于野猫的信息，请参阅猫咪保护基础指导之野猫篇。

Cats as companion animals 想要与之作伴的猫科动物

It is important to remember that a cat’s requirements are not human-based, so understanding their needs can enhance our own relationship with them. It is very rewarding to see things from their point of view to make a positive change in their welfare. Ensure you provide a stimulating and safe environment and provide your cat with opportunities to express their natural behaviour. 

认识到猫的需求和人类不同很重要，这样我们就能更好的搞好人与猫的关系。从猫的视角出发考虑问题对于提升它们的生活质量很有裨益。你需要确保你给予了它足够逼真而且安全的环境并且给它足够的机会释放天性。

Solitary 孤独

Like the African wildcat, pet cats have an inherent desire to maintain a territory as solitary hunters. However, they can live well together in some circumstances, as long as the cats perceive each other to be in the same social group and they have sufficient resources provided so there is no competition. 

像非洲野猫一样，宠物猫同样继承了维护领地的孤独狩猎者般的特质。然而，它们在食物等资源充足的情况下也会结成群体并且和谐共存。

Many groups of cats living in the same household have not evolved naturally, but have been introduced as unrelated kittens or adults. Consequently they may not actually perceive each other to be in the same social group, but under stress will tolerate the presence of others, especially for a particularly valued resource such as food or fuss from an owner. Cats are in the same social group if they sleep touching one another and spend time rubbing and grooming each other. Cats in one social group should be provided with separate resources – eg food, water, toilet and resting areas – from those in a different social group, even if they all live in the same house. In fact, it may even be best to feed those in the same social group in different areas to avoid the risk of relationship breakdown. 

很多在同一户人家生存的猫群并没有慢慢成为族群，它们可能不会真正接受彼此成为同一群体，而是在关键资源比如主人的食物的前提下，容忍了其他猫的存在。在同一族群的猫会睡在一起并且花时间互相梳理毛发。在同一个群体的猫就算生活在一起，也应该分别喂食，否则可能有因为争抢食物关系破裂的可能。

Introducing a new cat should be done very slowly in the hope that they will ultimately perceive each other to be in the same social group, or at least peacefully cohabit because they have been provided with separate resources to avoid conflict and competition. Each new relationship is dependent on the individual cats and how their early encounters were managed. 

介绍猫咪互相认识应该做到尽量慢，让其能够接受彼此或者是和谐共存本来就不是一定能达成的事情。每段关系的建立都取决于每只猫的个性以及早期的经历。

Just because a cat has lived happily with a cat before, it does not mean that it will take to a new feline companion. Unfortunately there is no guarantee, even with careful management, that the introduction of unfamiliar cats will work out. There are some cats that are unlikely to ever perceive other felines as anything but a threat and may prefer to live on their own. For more information, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Cats living together. 

即便这只猫在之前曾经和别的猫建立过很好的关系，也不意味着它能够轻易接受另一只猫。坏消息的是，即便是悉心安排，新猫咪也不一定能够被接纳。有些猫咪几乎不太可能接受任何其他猫并且只想独自过活。需要更多信息，请参阅猫咪保护基础指导之群居篇。

Many cats have learned to love the company of people and will often rub up against us for a fuss and a stroke and to place their comforting scent on us. It is a wonderful feeling when a cat chooses to engage with you. For more information on how cats interact with people, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Cats and people. 

很多猫已经接受了人的陪伴，也会经常磨人求抚摸，并且留下让它们以为安心的气味。被一只猫喜欢是一种很棒的感觉。需要更多关于猫和人之间互动的信息，请参阅猫咪保护基本指导之猫和人篇。

Hunters 猎手

Domestic cats are still programmed to hunt and this activity is still not linked to hunger. Each part of the hunting activity – the stalk, pounce, play and kill – releases feel-good hormones called endorphins. Cats need to have frequent successful ‘kills’ to avoid frustration and are most likely to hunt at dawn and dusk. Some cats are prolific hunters, while others catch nothing at all – it varies from individual to individual. Like their wild ancestors, those which do hunt will often bring their prey back to their home, or core area. For more information on hunting, see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Indoor and outdoor cats. 

家猫体内依然有着狩猎的基因，并且这一活动与饥饿并无关联。狩猎的每个过程（跟踪、弹跳、玩弄、杀死猎物）都会释放名为内啡肽的荷尔蒙。猫需要经常进行“成功”的狩猎才能避免无聊。狩猎通常会在早晨和傍晚。有的猫捕猎很厉害，而有些猫不然。和它们的野外祖先一样，家猫也会将猎物带回家。需要更多关于狩猎的信息，请参阅猫咪保护基本指导之室内室外猫篇。

Play is an excellent outlet for cats to exhibit this natural behaviour. Younger cats will be happy to play 10 times a day or more. You can learn more in Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Caring for your cat.

玩耍对于猫咪来说是绝好的释放天性的机会。幼猫可能需要每天玩10次以上。你可以在猫咪保护基础指导之关爱你的猫篇得到更多猫咪玩耍的指导。

Older cats will love playing three or four times a day, but the type of play may need to be adapted to suit their needs and level of mobility. For more information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Elderly cats. 

成年的猫可能需要每天适度玩耍三或四次。具体请参见猫咪保护基本指导之老年猫篇。

Eating can be a vulnerable activity. Try placing food bowls slightly away from the wall, so that your cat can eat with its back to it when they eat. Being able to view their surroundings can help them feel safer. 

进食可能是相对容易发生危险的活动，你可以尽量将食碗放在离墙壁稍远的地方，这样你的猫就能背对着墙进食。能够环顾四周能让猫感到安全。

Cats in the wild spend a lot of their time on frequent hunting expeditions, catching up to 12 small rodents per day. In comparison, our pet cats are given bowls of food, so a meal doesn’t take long to eat or make use of their great senses. Create interest at meal times by hiding food around the house for your cat to search out. Make a pyramid out of cardboard toilet roll tubes and hide food in the tubes, or use a puzzle ball or feeder. For more information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Feeding and obesity. 

野外的猫花费很多时间长途奔袭狩猎，有时候一天能抓到12只小型猎物。而我们的宠物猫则不缺食物，进食间隔很短而且不需要其良好的感觉系统。你可以把食物藏在屋子的某个角落让其发现，或者是用卫生纸筒做一个金字塔并且把食物放进去。当然也可以用滚球状的漏食器。需要更多信息请参阅猫咪保护基本指导之喂食与肥胖篇。


Communication systems 沟通方式

The cat has limited visual social signals and facial expressions and so can be difficult to ‘read.’ Instead, it still relies on scent communication, marking its territory and leaving distant scent signals that last for some time. This allows it to communicate to other cats as well as leave signals and warnings for itself. Cats will rub against items in the home to lay their scent which helps them feel safe and secure. It is worth bearing in mind that modern cleaning means we may be constantly removing this scent from the cat’s environment, which can cause some anxiety and disorientation. Modern lifestyles also mean we bring new scents into the environment. Cats will often spray the edges of their territory. Usually this is outdoors, but they may spray indoors – often at entry or exit points, such as windows or doorways. A cat that sprays indoors is leaving itself a warning reminder – it is indicating that something is wrong. This behaviour can be seen in any cat – male or female, whether neutered or not. 

猫并不具备良好的视觉，其面部表情也不足以传达太多信息。所以取而代之的，是靠气味的沟通方式。通过气味来标记领地以及传递能够留存一顿时间的气味信号，猫可以同其他同类沟通，并且给自己留下不同的记号。猫通常会在家中磨蹭不同的物件留下自己的气味来使自己感到安全。需要注意的是，现代的清洁手段很可能会经常消灭这种气味，导致猫感到焦虑不安。现代的生活方式同时意味着经常会有新的气味进入到猫的生活环境中。猫会经常在领地边缘喷尿做标记。这通常会在室外，但是也可能是在室内的出入口，比如窗户或者门口。在室内喷尿的猫是在给自己留下提醒信号——“情况不正常”。这种行为可能会发生在任何猫的身上，无论是公猫还是母猫，已绝育或者是未绝育。

Domestic cats scratch to keep their claws in good condition and to mark their territory. A scratching post will provide exercise, claw maintenance and a focal point for your cat to express this natural behaviour – it will help protect your furniture too. Cats like to stretch and scratch after they wake up, so try placing the scratch post near their bed. A good scratching post has the following features: 

家猫通过磨爪子来保持其爪子的锋利程度，同时也是其领地的一种标记。猫抓板能够很好地让猫释放天性、保持爪子的锋利，同时也能保护你得家具不遭毒手。猫喜欢在睡醒后伸展身体然后磨爪子。所以可以在他们的床边放上猫抓板。好的猫抓板有以下特征：

. a strong sturdy base so the cat can lean against the post without it wobbling 
· 坚固结实的底部，保证猫倚在猫爪板上时不会摇晃。

. tall enough that the cat can stretch fully 
· 足够高，这样猫能够完全的伸展身体。

. a vertical thread that allows the cat to scratch downwards 
· 有个竖直的磨爪面，这样猫能够从上向下磨爪子。


Avoidance of stress and conflict 避免焦虑以及冲突

Cats are all individuals and some may be more affected by stress than others. The domestic cat still needs the opportunity to run, hide and climb when stressed. Pet cats will often find appropriate places at home – such as in a cupboard or underneath the bed – and are best not disturbed when in these sanctuaries to allow their stress levels to come down. They will only fight if there is no other option available, or they have learned from previous experiences that this has a positive outcome for them. Cats will use scent to try to avoid conflict. 

猫都是独立的个体，某些可能更容易受到焦虑的影响。家猫在感受到压力的时候需要跑动、隐藏、攀爬。宠物猫通常能够在家中找到合适的地方，比如茶柜或者是床下。最好不要在其处在它的小庇护所正感到精神紧张的时候惊动它，而是应该让其自然放松。猫只会在走投无路的情况下选择动粗，也可能是之前的经历告诉它动粗可能会有好处。猫咪通常会用气味避免冲突。

It is important to always provide your cat with an easily accessible place to hide which will help to make them feel safe and secure. There are many things that can cause a cat to feel anxious or fearful: fireworks, building work in the house, unfamiliar visitors, or conflict with other cats. A hiding place can be something as simple as a cardboard box on its side, or upside down, with large holes for access. Or you could purchase an igloo style cat bed. Try not to overly fuss a cat which is showing signs of fear, as it may reinforce the fearfulness. 

给你的猫准备很容易到达的庇护所很重要，这样能让它们感到安全。很多情况都会让猫感到焦虑或者是恐惧，比如烟火、装修、不熟悉的访客以及和其他猫的冲突。庇护所可以是很简单的带一个圆孔的纸盒子。或者你可以给它买一个雪屋状的猫床。不要再猫害怕的时候过度抚摸它，这样可能加剧它的恐惧。

Cats feel safer if they can view their surroundings from a height. Provide some higher spaces for your cat to relax, such as shelves or the top of a wardrobe. Ensure the cat can access these, for example by placing a stool nearby. Extra consideration should be given to elderly cats. For more information see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Elderly cats. 

如果能居高临下俯瞰四周，猫通常都会感到安全。所以给猫提供书架或者是碗柜这样的高处可以让猫更加放松。你可在旁边放一个猫爬架来帮助猫达到高处。对于老年猫，则需要更多的关注。更多信息请参加猫咪保护基本指导之老年猫篇。

Sleep 休息

Cats usually sleep for about 16 hours a day, on and off, and often prefer to rotate their chosen sleeping area. When a cat falls asleep on our lap, we often don’t realise they’ve drifted off and continue to stroke them. Most cats that are woken suddenly by their owner stroking them will realise what is happening. However, others can feel understandably sleepy and disorientated and may react defensively to a perceived threat. If your cat is resting on your lap, it’s best to stop stroking them so that they can sleep peacefully. 

猫每天会断断续续睡大约16个小时，并且经常会变更睡觉的场所。当猫在我们的大腿上睡着的时候，很多时候我们并不会注意到，仍然抚摸它。通常时候猫能够意识到是主人的抚摸，但有的猫可能会感到特别困倦而且被打扰，可能会产生过激的行为。如果你的猫在你大腿上睡着了，最好的方法是不要打扰它。

Toileting 如厕

Cats learn to associate toileting with the material used when they were a kitten and generally still prefer to use a fine grain litter. If they were only exposed to one type as a kitten, they are less likely to want to use a different litter consistency as an adult. They will dig and bury deposits and prefer to use a site away from where they eat and drink, in quiet, private areas away from other cats. 

猫在幼猫起就学会了排泄所需砂土的使用，通常都会倾向于砂砾质感的猫砂。如果小时候只用过一种猫砂，那长大了就会排除其他种类的猫砂。它们会在猫砂中挖洞然后把排泄物埋起来。猫通常喜欢在远离食物和水源并且安静私密不会被其他猫打扰的地方排泄。

Your cat may prefer to go inside in a litter tray or outside in the garden – it varies between individuals. Even if your cat toilets outside, it’s a good idea to keep a litter tray indoors for those moments when they are caught short! 

你的猫可能会喜欢在室内使用猫砂盆，也可能喜欢在室外花园排泄。不同的猫有不同的倾向。即便你的猫倾向在室外排泄，你也最好在室内放置一个猫砂盆，以防万一。

It’s best to have one litter tray per cat, plus one extra if possible, all in different quiet locations – especially if your cats are kept indoors. Cats don’t like using dirty or soiled trays so make sure the litter tray is cleaned at least once a day. 

当你的猫是完全养在室内的时候，你应该给每个猫准备一个猫砂盆，最好多准备一个，全部分布在不同的安静的位置。猫不喜欢脏的、已经被污染的猫砂。所以确保每天都清理猫砂盆。

If your cat toilets outside, provide them with their own desirable toilet area in your garden, in a secluded, sheltered area of well-dug, fine soil. Add some cat litter to encourage them to toilet there. Make sure it’s dug over regularly to remain hygienic and allow the soiled material to decompose naturally. 

如果你的猫在室外排泄，你可以给它在花园里找一个隐蔽的、有遮挡的、松软好挖的地方，作为排泄的场所。你可以在这个地方放一些猫砂来鼓励它在这排泄。确保猫能正常挖坑不会接触到不卫生的土壤，已经排泄过的土壤能够自然分解。

Being creatures of habit, once a cat has a preferred toileting site, they will continue to use it unless something causes them to become averse to it. A lack of privacy and problems with access or cleanliness will cause them to look for another place. 
For more information, see Cat’s Protection’s Essential Guide: Managing your cat’s behaviour. 

作为循规蹈矩的生物，一旦猫有了固定的如厕场所，它就会一直用下去，直到有别的因素使它开始讨厌这个地方。容易被打扰、不容易进入、不干净等因素都会导致猫找寻新的排泄地点。需要更多信息，请参加猫咪保护基本指导之管理猫的行为。

Water 饮水 

Cats tend to avoid stagnant pools and often prefer a moving water source away from food bowls and litter trays. They also like wide brimmed containers with a reflective surface. Some cats choose to drink from a natural water source outside because they dislike the taste of chlorinated water or the taint from a plastic bowl. Even in these situations, fresh water should still always be available indoors in case their outdoor source dries up or becomes inaccessible. Others prefer a dripping tap, or to dip their paw into the water and drink off their paw. 

相较于静止的水源，猫咪通常会倾向于远离食物和猫砂盆的流动水。它们也喜欢有宽广边缘、有反射水面的水源。有些猫会讨厌自来水的氯气味道或者是水碗的味道，而倾向于在户外饮用自然水源。即便是这样，你也应该在室内放置新鲜的水源，以免室外水源枯竭或者是猫出不去。其他有的猫可能喜欢滴水的水龙头，或者是把爪子浸到水中再饮用。

Reproduction 生殖

Cats can become sexually active from four months of age. Females will call when in season and with large territory sizes, males will travel long distances to find receptive females. With the provision of food and shelter and other key resources, cats can be prolific breeders and one female cat – queen – and her offspring can be responsible for 20,000 kittens in just five years. 

猫最早在四个月大就可以实现生殖成熟。母猫会在发情期嚎叫。鉴于猫的领地通常很大，公猫需要长途奔袭来交配。如果食物和场所等生存资源适宜，猫可以相当高产。一个母猫能够在五年内产生20000只后代。

Any kittens born need to experience as many positive experiences as possible during their first two to eight weeks of age for them to consider these safe and normal in future, enabling them to become happy pets. Cats Protection recommends neutering by around four months of age to prevent unwanted litters. 

在初生的前两周到八周，幼猫如果能受到足够的正向体验，就会养成足够的安全感，成为快乐的猫。CATS PROTECTION 建议在四个月的时候就进行绝育，以减少猫咪数量。

Individuals 个性

Individual cats have different characters and this contributes to their appeal. Their differences are due to a variety of different factors and are influenced by: 

不同的猫可能有不同的个性，这也会影响它们的行为需求。猫的个性取决于很多不同的因素：

. genetics 
· 基因

. stress levels of the mother when pregnant 
· 猫的母亲怀孕时候的情绪紧张水平

. learning during the early part of life, including: 
· 初生时期的早期认知学习，包括：

. experiences during their socialisation period 
· 社交时期的经历

. behaviour learned from siblings – such as how to play 
· 来自兄弟姐妹的行为学习，比如如何玩耍。

. behaviour learned from the mother – eg how to deal with frustration, such as during weaning 
· 来自母亲的行为学习，也即如何处理挫折，比如断奶时。

. later learning experiences, including: 
· 后期的经历，包括：

. a cat developing an association between its own behaviour and the consequence of that behaviour. For example, miaowing leads to my owner letting me in, so I will miaow when I want to be let in 
· 猫会把自己的行为和后果做关联，比如喵喵叫会让我的主人放我进屋，那么当我需要进屋的时候就会喵喵叫。

. a cat developing an association between something that originally meant nothing to it and associating it with meaning something new. For example, a cat learns that the sound of a tin opener means they are about to be fed, so will come running when they hear the tin opener being taken out of a drawer 
· 猫会把某些原本没有意思的事物赋予意义。比如猫可能发现每次开罐器的声音出现之后，自己就会有罐头吃。那么当它听到开罐器被拿出抽屉的声音后，就会跑过来等吃的。

. medical conditions 
· 医疗条件

. current environment 
· 现在的环境



The indoor life 室内的猫咪生活

Many cats will enjoy going outside for part of the day and this gives them the opportunity to investigate new things and make use of their fantastic senses. It also provides mental stimulation and reduces stress. If you are keeping cats indoors, extra care is needed to avoid boredom, frustration or the development of behaviour problems – see Cats Protection’s Essential Guide: Indoor and outdoor cats. 

很多猫都会喜欢每天出门玩一会，这样它们绝佳的感官就会被充分利用来探索新的事物。外出同样给与猫精神上的愉悦并且避免它的焦虑紧张。如果你把猫完全养在室内，你需要想办法避免它的无聊产生相关的行为问题。参见猫咪保护基本指导之室内室外猫篇。

Interacting with your cat and body language 和你的猫互动，以及猫的身体语言

Cats like quite brief, low intensity but frequent interactions. When cats that get along greet each other, it tends to be a brief head rub. Unfortunately, humans are the opposite! Our interactions are generally less frequent, but when we have them, they are generally of high intensity and prolonged. This can sometimes be a source of confusion between cats and their owners. 、

猫偏好简短、高频率的互动。不同的猫打招呼的时候通常只会是简单地蹭蹭头。不幸的是，这和人通常的互动方式恰恰相反。人类的互动通常是低频、高强度、长时间的。这种区别有的时候会造成猫和人之间的误解。

Cats can get quite stimulated or excited when they are playing or in ‘hunting mode’ and it’s generally not advisable to touch any cat in this state. Even when touching a calm, relaxed cat, there are many places on the body that are quite vulnerable or sensitive. While there are always exceptions, as a general rule, many cats don’t like to be touched in these places: 

猫在玩耍或者处在“狩猎模式”的时候可能会相当兴奋。这时不建议继续和猫互动。即便是触摸一个安静放松的猫，也有很多身体上的敏感部位。通常情况下，猫不喜欢被触摸以下部位：

. belly – which for some cats can include their sides and chest 
· 肚子，有的猫还不喜欢被摸肚子侧面以及胸部

. paws 
· 爪子

. under legs – ie armpits 
· 腋下

. legs – trousers – back legs 
· 后腿

. stroking the fur against the normal direction 
· 反方向抚摸它们的猫

. bottom half of back – particularly if stiff or painful 
· 后背部

. base of tail 
· 尾巴根部

. genital area 
· 生殖器部位


Learning to understand your cat by reading their body language is a fascinating part of owning a cat and it can improve the relationship between you.
